## Announcements

* EX1 in the books. Nice work. A few little bugs in questions, but avg is already 93%. 

* Many office hours this week to help w machine setup. You'll need it for Projects, and
for your future.

A handcraft is a collection of [\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_]{.underline}.
Every [\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_]{.underline} has a [\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_]{.underline}, and a collection of [\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_]{.underline}.
Every [\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_]{.underline} is a collection of [\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_]{.underline}.
Every [\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_]{.underline} is either "knit" or "purl," and is drawn as a [\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_]{.underline}.

## Design Strategies

1.  Decompose a problem into classes

2.  List the data associated with each class

3.  Write the "driver" code that illustrates the functionality you expect from each class.

4.  Implement the functions you expect.

5.  Run the driver code to test your functionality.

## Which classes?

Image is like a canvas... we have to draw on it.

## Translation 

From stitch coordinates to pixel coordinates

ImageDraw.Rectangle(xy, fill):

- xy is [(x0,y0),(x1,y1)] a bounding box, inclusive.
- fill is a color

## Interface

A row has a list of stitches:

``` python
class row:
  ...
  stitches: list[stitch]
  ...
```

But we want to declare rows like:

``` python
r1 = row('KKKPPPKP')
```

To do this, we need a function to translate between string of `K`, `P` and `stitch` objects.

Define `__init__`: special function invoked for you by the system when variable is declared.
