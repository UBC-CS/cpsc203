## Data structure: Queue

To orchestrate the fill, we'll use a data structure called a *queue*.

![](/images/penguins.jpg){fig-alt="A line of penguins stretches across an ice floe and they jump from its edge into the ocean."}

Queue:

`enqueue(k)`: Places data `k` onto the structure at the end

`dequeue()`: Removes and returns the "first" element from the structure

# Class demo: Motivating queues

## In Python: `Collections.deque`

Pronounced "deck"
