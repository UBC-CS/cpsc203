**Summary**

Today we explore the concept of representation in two important senses. First, we examine how computers represent rich, culturally complex concepts like colour using simple numbers. Second, we use colour representation as a metaphor for diversity and inclusion in computer science - just as removing a colour channel limits the colours we can create, limiting diversity of experience limits the ideas we can explore. We conclude by seeing this representation in action through image manipulation code.
:::

## Learning outcomes

1.  Computers interpret electrical signals as bits, and bits can be used to represent numbers, and numbers can be used to represent colours, which suggests that we can represent virtually *anything*!

## Representation

Today we're exploring a fundamental question: How do we *represent* the world as data?

We'll look at "representation" in two important senses:

- **Technical**: How computers encode rich concepts (like colour) as numbers
- **Social**: Who is represented in this discipline, and why it matters

Let's start with something personal and familiar: colour.

## Colour interpretation

What's your favorite colour?
Do you have a sense for *why* it's your favorite?
Does that colour influence your dress/decor/purchases?

::: notes
Can we represent any integer this way?
YES!
Until we run out of memory.
But we have more memory than we can even conceive of.

How does this help us with colour?

## Colour---representation

Can we use integers to represent colours?

One way: RGB (red, green, blue), where each "component" is in range 0 through 255.

ex. (`255, 0, 127`) == [[]{.swatch-purple} []{.swatch-cyan} []{.swatch-lime} []{.swatch-pink} []{.swatch-apricot}]{style="position: relative; top: 11px;"}

Fun calculator for colour values: <https://colorizer.org>

How many bits for 256 values?
`4  5  6  7  8  9  10`

## Colour---representation

What colour is

::: small-font-size
\

`0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1`

\
:::

Easier to read if we use *hexadecimal* representation:

Each component is represented by 2 hex digits `0123456789abcdef`

ex. `#674ea7` []{.swatch-purple} []{.swatch-cyan} []{.swatch-lime} []{.swatch-pink} []{.swatch-orange}

::: notes
Hex = base 16
:::

## Colour---hexadecimal

What colour is this 24-bit number?

::: small-font-size
\

`0110 0111 0100 1110 1010 0111`

\
:::

Converting to hexadecimal: `#___________`

(Use digits `0123456789abcdef`)

::: notes
Walk through conversion on board:
- First 8 bits (0110 0111) = Red channel
- Next 8 bits (0100 1110) = Green channel
- Last 8 bits (1010 0111) = Blue channel
- Convert each 4-bit group to hex digit
- Result: #674ea7

## Representation: Two Meanings

What do you observe about the following RGB colours?

| Red | Green | Blue |
|:---:|:-----:|:----:|
| 255 |   0   |  0   |
| 17  |   0   | 178  |
| 45  |   0   |  13  |
| 200 |   0   | 220  |
| 62  |   0   |  37  |
| 130 |   0   |  95  |

## Colour and Code {.smaller}

Make the poppies pop!

Examine each pixel.
If its red colour channel is high (over 200, say), then leave it as is.
Otherwise, change the pixel to grey by setting all 3 colour channels to the average of their original values.

## Colour and Code

```{pyodide}
import numpy as np
from skimage import io
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

Pixel = tuple[np.uint8, np.uint8, np.uint8]  # (r, g, b)

'''Input: Pixel p
   Output: Pixel
   Function: If the pixel has high red value, then don't change it, otherwise
   fade the pixel to grey.  Note, to grey a pixel, set all colour channels to
   the average of the 3.
'''
def boost_red_pixel(p: Pixel) -> Pixel:
    # setup -- extract the colour channels as ints
    red = int(p[0])
    green = int(p[1])
    blue = int(p[2])

    # compute grey 


    # conditionally change the pixel to grey


    # return updated pixel
    return (red, green, blue)

''' Input: np.ndarray representing an image
    Output: an np.ndarray representing an image
    Function: Create a new image by appling the boost_red_pixel 
    function to every pixel in the original, and saving the 
    result to the copy.
'''

def fancify(img: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    H, W = img.shape[:2] # grab the height and width of the image
    out = img.copy()     # write to a copy -- easy way to get the size right

    # traverse every pixel in the image and write to the copy!
    


    # return image with changed pixels
    return out

def main() -> None:
    
    img = io.imread('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UBC-CS/cpsc203/refs/heads/main/images/poppyfield.jpg')[..., :3]     # read from website, keep first 3 channels (RGB)
    
    out = fancify(img)            # make a new fancy image

    plt.imshow(out)               # output the results
    plt.axis('off')
    plt.show()

main()

## {{< var icon.computer-activity >}} Your turn: Change image or boost {.activity}

Experiment with the code! Try one or more of these:

1. Find a different image URL and boost a different colour (green? blue?)
2. Change the threshold value (try 150 instead of 200)
3. Instead of greying, try inverting: `red = 255 - red`
4. What happens if you boost pixels that are LOW in red instead of high?
