**Summary**

In this introductory class, we use metaphors and abstractions to characterize problem decomposition, code as a communication mechanism, and computational efficiency.
We continue our exploration of the idea of elegance, making connections to problem solving and code.
Then, we learn a mechanism for measuring efficiency, and talk briefly about why it's important to consider.
The discussion about efficiency is followed by a diversion into color representation.
Finally, we look at some code!
The day concludes with a sequence of Python examples designed to clear the cobwebs on lists -- our first data structure!
:::

## Learning outcomes

1. We connect the idea of "elegance" to common items and to software design!

2. The *time* it takes to solve a problem is one way of measuring the size of a
problem. That time can often be described by simple mathematical function.

## Elegance: Continuing the discussion

On Tuesday we introduced **elegance** as a conceptual metaphor for software engineering.

We looked at the scissors example---form perfectly matched to function, with no unnecessary complexity.

Today, we're going to dig deeper into this idea:

- What does elegance look like across different contexts?
- How do we define it more precisely?
- How does this apply to the way we solve problems in computing?

::: notes
1)  INGENUITY --- The problems themselves are no longer straightforward examples of things we've seen before. Class is about creating a larger set of tools and the confident deployment of them.
2)  SIMPLICITY --- Our software should be considered to be a means of communicating with other humans who want to know how we have solved the problem. Humans are not good readers, but they think they are good programmers, so if they cannot understand our solution, then they will just rewrite it! (Complexity gives people a reason not to connect).

Metaphor for software development---ingenuity, function, simplicity, resource constraints.
But also a direct parallel.
Knitting patterns, in particular, are communicated using language very similar to Python, so our first experiences are going to exploit the metaphor.

## Quantifying the Task

If we are solving a problem [\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_]{.underline} for a given input, we can parameterize the running time of the solution by the size of the input.

We usually denote this input size using the variable $n$.

First blank: or write an algorithm

1.  In this example we choose to label $n$ as the side-length
2.  We don't care so much about units, so we communicate using the largest order term so a scarf which is always 3$n$ x $n$ takes time 3$n^2$ to knit, we ignore the 3 when we're talking about algorithms. It's the squared part that really determines how long we'll have to wait. We say that the variable term "dominates".
3.  Sometimes we have more than one parameter

script: walk through existing code. counting stitches is the same as counting time.

which line is executed most frequently? 
how many times is outer forloop executed?
how many times is line (inner for loop) executed?

let's demonstrate the work with ascii art! change code incrementally
produce one row at a time. (add empty row)
for each column, add a "stitch"
row done, so print it out.

have we done more work? a little, but the most frequent line happens the
same number of times.

## Quantifying the Task

Suppose we can knit 10^12^ stitches per second...

|            | 10        | 100       | 1000      | 10,000   | 10^12^   |
|------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|----------|----------|
| $n$        | 10^-11^s | 10^-10^ s | 10^-9^ s  | 10^-8^ s | 1 s      |
| $n \log n$ | 10^-11^ s | 10^-9^ s  | 10^-8^ s  | 10^-7^ s | 40 s     |
| $n^2$      | 10^-10^ s | 10^-8^ s  | 10^-6^ s  | 10^-4^ s | 10^12^ s |
| $n^3$      | 10^-9^ s  | 10^-6^ s  | 10^-3^ s  | 1 s      | 10^24^ s |
| $2^n$      | 10^-9^ s  | 10^18^ s  | 10^289^ s |          |          |

The amount of computation we do inside our algorithm actually matters!

::: notes
Why does this matter?

Annotate:

1.  Each stitch takes a tiny tiny fraction of a second 1/10^12^ = 10^-12^ (fastest machine is 415 x 10^15^).
2.  $n$ is size parameter for our computation.
3.  $T(n)$ is the amount of time our computation takes.

Choose one to illustrate if our rag/data size is 1000, and we need to compute n^3^ steps/stitches (like knitting a cube!!), then the total time is 1000^3^/10^12^ = 10^-3^ a thousandth of a second.
Nbd.

BUT let's look at bigger data.
10^12^ (\~128gb pretty big) 10^12^ mm = 1M km, 384,400 km to the moon.
149M km to the sun.
So knitting something that big would take 10^12^ s = \~32000 years.
The sun will long since have burnt out by 10^18^ s

Punchline---we don't want to do $2^n$ amount of computation, and we need creative approaches for big data.

Recap---we've seen a problem whose size we characterize by $n^2$, we'll see problems whose time we characterize by $n$, for sure, and later in the term, we'll see a problem which is very simply stated, whose size we characterize by $2^n$.
🙁

NOTE: $\log$ is $\log_2$.
And $\log 1000 = 10$.
