**Summary**

In this introductory class, we use metaphors and abstractions to characterize problem decomposition, code as a communication mechanism, and computational efficiency.
We continue our exploration of the idea of elegance, making connections to problem solving and code.
Then, we learn a mechanism for measuring efficiency, and talk briefly about why it's important to consider.
The discussion about efficiency is followed by a diversion into color representation.
Finally, we look at some code!
The day concludes with a sequence of Python examples designed to clear the cobwebs on lists -- our first data structure!

## Learning outcomes

1.  Computers interpret electrical signals as bits, and bits can be used to represent numbers, and numbers can be used to represent colors, which suggests that we can represent virtually *anything*!

## Warm Up 

Suppose we can knit 10^12^ stitches per second...

|            | 10        | 100       | 1000      | 10,000   | 10^12^   |
|------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|----------|----------|
| $n$        | 10^-11^s | 10^-10^ s | 10^-9^ s  | 10^-8^ s | 1 s      |
| $n \log n$ | 10^-11^ s | 10^-9^ s  | 10^-8^ s  | 10^-7^ s | 40 s     |
| $n^2$      | 10^-10^ s | 10^-8^ s  | 10^-6^ s  | 10^-4^ s | 10^12^ s |
| $n^3$      | 10^-9^ s  | 10^-6^ s  | 10^-3^ s  | 1 s      | 10^24^ s |
| $2^n$      | 10^-9^ s  | 10^18^ s  | 10^289^ s |          |          |

The amount of computation we do inside our algorithm actually matters!

::: notes
Why does this matter?

Annotate:

1.  Each stitch takes a tiny tiny fraction of a second 1/10^12^ = 10^-12^ (fastest machine is 415 x 10^15^).
2.  $n$ is size parameter for our computation.
3.  $T(n)$ is the amount of time our computation takes.

Choose one to illustrate if our rag/data size is 1000, and we need to compute n^3^ steps/stitches (like knitting a cube!!), then the total time is 1000^3^/10^12^ = 10^-3^ a thousandth of a second.
Nbd.

BUT let's look at bigger data.
10^12^ (\~128gb pretty big) 10^12^ mm = 1M km, 384,400 km to the moon.
149M km to the sun.
So knitting something that big would take 10^12^ s = \~32000 years.
The sun will long since have burnt out by 10^18^ s

Punchline---we don't want to do $2^n$ amount of computation, and we need creative approaches for big data.

Recap---we've seen a problem whose size we characterize by $n^2$, we'll see problems whose time we characterize by $n$, for sure, and later in the term, we'll see a problem which is very simply stated, whose size we characterize by $2^n$.
üôÅ

NOTE: $\log$ is $\log_2$.
And $\log 1000 = 10$.

# Representation

## Colour interpretation

What's your favorite color?
Do you have a sense for *why* it's your favorite?
Does that color influence your dress/decor/purchases?

Psychological: <https://www.buzzfeed.com/mermaidbarbie/which-color-truly-matches-your-personality-24h9koy69s>

Cultural: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_symbolism>

[]{.hexagon-red}[]{.hexagon-orange}[]{.hexagon-yellow}[]{.hexagon-green}[]{.hexagon-blue}[]{.hexagon-violet}

## {{< iconify fa6-solid comments >}} Your turn: Colour---cultural interpretations {.activity .smaller}

Activity---In pairs, choose a color (primary or secondary) and find something in its cultural symbolism that surprises you.
Contradictions are especially interesting.
Report your findings to the class (briefly).

First, some general questions‚Ä¶

What does data look like to a computer?

\
\

Is that enough?

## Colour---representation

Can we use bits to represent integers?

|       |       |       |       |
|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| 3     | 1     | 5     | 7     |
| 10^3^ | 10^2^ | 10^1^ | 10^0^ |

|  |  |  |  |
|----|----|----|----|
| [10^3^]{.text-hidden} | [10^2^]{.text-hidden} | [10^1^]{.text-hidden} | [10^0^]{.text-hidden} |
| [2]{.text-hidden}^3^ | [2]{.text-hidden}^2^ | [2]{.text-hidden}^1^ | [2]{.text-hidden}^0^ |

## Colour---representation

What's the highest number we can represent with 4 bits?

\
\

What's the highest number we can represent with 5 bits?

\
\

How many bits do we need to express 120?

\
\

::: notes
Can we represent any integer this way?
YES!
Until we run out of memory.
But we have more memory than we can even conceive of.

How does this help us with color?
:::

## Colour---representation

Can we use integers to represent colors?

One way: RGB (red, green, blue), where each "component" is in range 0 through 255.

ex. (`255, 0, 127`) == [[]{.swatch-purple} []{.swatch-cyan} []{.swatch-lime} []{.swatch-pink} []{.swatch-apricot}]{style="position: relative; top: 11px;"}

Fun calculator for color values: <https://colorizer.org>

How many bits for 256 values?
`4  5  6  7  8  9  10`

## Colour---representation

What color is

::: small-font-size
\

`0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1`

\
:::

Easier to read if we use *hexadecimal* representation:

Each component is represented by 2 hex digits `0123456789abcdef`

ex. `#674ea7` []{.swatch-purple} []{.swatch-cyan} []{.swatch-lime} []{.swatch-pink} []{.swatch-orange}

::: notes
Hex = base 16

## Colour---representation (aside)

What do you observe about the following RGB colors?

| Red | Green | Blue |
|:---:|:-----:|:----:|
| 255 |   0   |  0   |
| 17  |   0   | 178  |
| 45  |   0   |  13  |
| 200 |   0   | 220  |
| 62  |   0   |  37  |
| 130 |   0   |  95  |


## Color and Code

We can change images by manipulating the colour of the pixels!
