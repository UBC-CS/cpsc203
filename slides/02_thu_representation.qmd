**Summary**

In this introductory class, we use metaphors and abstractions to characterize problem decomposition, code as a communication mechanism, and computational efficiency.
We continue our exploration of the idea of elegance, making connections to problem solving and code.
Then, we learn a mechanism for measuring efficiency, and talk briefly about why it's important to consider.
The discussion about efficiency is followed by a diversion into color representation.
Finally, we look at some code!
The day concludes with a sequence of Python examples designed to clear the cobwebs on lists -- our first data structure!
:::

## Learning outcomes

1.  Computers interpret electrical signals as bits, and bits can be used to represent numbers, and numbers can be used to represent colors, which suggests that we can represent virtually *anything*!


# Representation

## Colour interpretation

What's your favorite color?
Do you have a sense for *why* it's your favorite?
Does that color influence your dress/decor/purchases?

Psychological: <https://www.playbuzz.com/jon10/what-color-matches-your-personality>

Cultural: <https://markedbydesign.net/blog/meaning-in-color>

## {{< iconify fa6-solid comments >}} Your turn: Colour---cultural interpretations {.activity .smaller}

Activity---In pairs, choose a color (primary or secondary) and find something in its cultural symbolism that surprises you.
Contradictions are especially interesting.
Report your findings to the group (briefly).

First, some general questionsâ€¦

What does data look like to a computer?

\
\

Is that enough?

1.  Positive and negative charges interpreted as 1 and 0.

## Colour---representation

Can we use bits to represent integers?

|       |       |       |       |
|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| 3     | 1     | 5     | 7     |
| 10^3^ | 10^2^ | 10^1^ | 10^0^ |

|  |  |  |  |
|----|----|----|----|
| [10^3^]{.text-hidden} | [10^2^]{.text-hidden} | [10^1^]{.text-hidden} | [10^0^]{.text-hidden} |
| [2]{.text-hidden}^3^ | [2]{.text-hidden}^2^ | [2]{.text-hidden}^1^ | [2]{.text-hidden}^0^ |

Talk about the BASE of the number.

## Colour---representation

What's the highest number we can represent with 4 bits?

\
\

What's the highest number we can represent with 5 bits?

\
\

How many bits do we need to express 127?

\
\

::: notes
Can we represent any integer this way?
YES!
Until we run out of memory.
But we have more memory than we can even conceive of.

How does this help us with color?
:::

## Colour---representation

Can we use integers to represent colors?

RGB (red, green, blue), where each "component" is in range 0 through 255.

ex. (`255, 0, 127`) == [[]{.swatch-purple} []{.swatch-cyan} []{.swatch-lime} []{.swatch-pink} []{.swatch-apricot}]{style="position: relative; top: 11px;"}

Fun calculator for color values: <https://colorizer.org>

How many bits for 256 values?
`4  5  6  7  8  9  10`

## Colour---representation

What color is

::: small-font-size
\

`0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1`

\
:::

Easier to read if we use *hexadecimal* representation:

Each component is represented by 2 hex digits `0123456789abcdef`

ex. `#674ea7` []{.swatch-purple} []{.swatch-cyan} []{.swatch-lime} []{.swatch-pink} []{.swatch-orange}

::: notes
Hex = base 16

## Colour---representation (aside)

What do you observe about the following RGB colors?

| Red | Green | Blue |
|:---:|:-----:|:----:|
| 255 |   0   |  0   |
| 17  |   0   | 178  |
| 45  |   0   |  13  |
| 200 |   0   | 220  |
| 62  |   0   |  37  |
| 130 |   0   |  95  |
