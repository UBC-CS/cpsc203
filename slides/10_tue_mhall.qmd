Supposing, for instance, that the **fundamental relations of** pitched **sounds** in the science of harmony and of musical composition were **susceptible of** such expression and **adaptations**, 

*the engine might compose elaborate and scientific pieces of music of any degree of complexity or extent.*

## Some Technical Details

* You have just learned about a particular type of random process called a *Markov Chain*.

* We modelled it using a transition table, or a *finite state machine*, and we used it as the basis for an algorithm to generate music.

This table can be interpreted as an *adjacency matrix* representation of a graph.

## Other Applications

* PageRank:  Google’s first search algorithm
    * Some pages are likely to “follow” (be linked from) others.
    * Rank of page is based on the probability that you’ll be there at any moment
* Natural Language Processing
    * Some words are more likely to follow others.
    * “I just ate the whole desert”  probably has a misspelling.
    * “For dinner I ___ ... ”    next word is probably “ate”
* DNA matching
* Chemical reaction simulation

Many others...
