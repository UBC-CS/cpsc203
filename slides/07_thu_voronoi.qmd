# Voronoi Diagrams

## Everyone needs a Tim Horton

:::::: columns
:::: {.column width="33%"}
::: small-font-size
Every address in Vancouver has a nearest TH.

Partition Vancouver into regions so that points are in the same region if they have the same nearest TH.

## Voronoi diagrams

:::::: columns
:::: {.column width="33%"}
::: small-font-size
Given a (finite) set of "centres" $c_{1}, c_{2}, \ldots, c_{k}$, a Voronoi region, $R_{j}$ consists of the set of points nearer to centre $c_{j}$, than to any other centre.

Together, the $R_{j}$ regions compose the Voronoi diagram of a plane.

::: notes
Every point in plane is in some region and no point is in 2 regions.

Mention that there were actually 3D models.
Also, **weighted** Voronoi diagrams...

## Computing Voronoi Diagrams {.smaller}

Choice of algorithm depends on the domain of the data. 

\ 

If real valued domain (like Cartesian Coords) then we use geometry, exploiting the fact that the Voronoi edges are perpendicular bisectors of the edge between 2 centers.

\ 

*Our* computation will always be on planar regions represented by images.

## Distance Between Pixels

Find the distance between 2 pixel locations:
