## Everyone needs a Tim Horton

:::::: columns
:::: {.column width="33%"}
::: small-font-size
Every address in Vancouver has a nearest TH.

Partition Vancouver into regions so that points are in the same region if they have the same nearest TH.

## Voronoi diagrams

:::::: columns
:::: {.column width="33%"}
::: small-font-size
Given a (finite) set of "centres" $c_{1}, c_{2}, \ldots, c_{k}$, a Voronoi region, $R_{j}$ consists of the set of points nearer to centre $c_{j}$, than to any other centre.

Together, the $R_{j}$ regions compose the Voronoi diagram of a plane.

The applications of this structure go far beyond our coffee fix!!

::: notes
Every point in plane is in some region and no point is in 2 regions.

::: notes
Mention that there were actually 3D models.
Also, **weighted** Voronoi diagrams...
