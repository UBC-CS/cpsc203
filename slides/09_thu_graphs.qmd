This graph can be used to quickly calculate whether a given number is divisible by 7.

Start at the circle node at the top.
For each digit $d$ in the given number, follow $d$ blue (solid) edges in succession. As you move from one digit to the next, follow 1 red (dashed) edge.
If you end up back at the circle node, your number is divisible by 7.

## Graph Explorations

\ 

A graph $G$ is defined by a set of vertices $V$, and a set of edges $E$. 

\ 

Algorithm _running time_ is typically described using the number of _vertices_, but execution usually depends on the number of _edges_, so we must understand the relationship between them.

## How Many Edges?

Suppose I tell you a connected graph has 100 vertices. What do we know about the number of edges?

::::: columns
::: {.column}
![](/images/gr2.png)
:::
::: {.column} 
_At least_ __________ edges because the graph is connected.

\ 

_At most_ _________ edges which occurs when the graph is complete.

## Handshaking

Suppose I tell you a graph has 28 vertices, each with degree 3. How many edges does it have?

::::: columns
::: {.column}
![](/images/gr8.png)
:::
::: {.column} 
The following are equivalent:

* The number of neighbors of a vertex.
* The number of incident edges of a vertex.
* The degree of a vertex.

## Degree Games

::::: columns
::: {.column}
Suppose I drop my graph and it shatters into pieces. If I tell you the degree of each of the vertices, can you reconstruct the graph?

:::
::: {.column} 
An algorithm for finding a graph, given a degree sequence, is described in the practice problems.

Trace each graph without lifting your pencil and without revisiting an edge.

\ 

Can all graphs be traced?

\ 

What characterizes those that cannot?
