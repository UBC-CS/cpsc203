First, we examine how computers represent rich, culturally complex concepts like colour using simple numbers. Second, we use colour representation as a metaphor for diversity and inclusion in computer science - just as removing a colour channel limits the colours we can create, limiting diversity of experience limits the ideas we can explore. We conclude by seeing this representation in action through image manipulation code."

We can get a hint of this by tracking the introduction of new terms in a novel. In the below visualizations (in which each column represents a chapter and each small block a paragraph of text), I maintain a variable which represents novelty. When a paragraph contains more than 25% new terms (i.e. words that have not been observed thus far) this variable is set at its maximum of 1. Otherwise, the variable decays. The variable is used to colour the paragraph with red being 1.0 and blue being 0. The result is that we can get an idea of the introduction of new ideas in novels.” - Matthew Hurst"

    "section": "What is Algorithmic Thinking?",
    "text": "What is Algorithmic Thinking?\nBefore we write a single line of code, let’s talk about what it means to think like a computer scientist. At its core, algorithmic thinking is about breaking problems down into clear, repeatable steps that can be followed to reach a solution. It’s a way of approaching problems that combines creativity with precision.\nThink about following a recipe. A good recipe doesn’t just say “make cookies”—it tells you exactly what ingredients you need, in what order to combine them, at what temperature to bake them, and for how long. That’s algorithmic thinking: taking a complex goal (delicious cookies) and breaking it down into manageable, executable steps.\nIf you’ve taken an introductory programming course, you might have learned systematic design processes—recipes for turning problem statements into working code. That’s algorithmic thinking in action! This term, we’re going to build on that foundation by asking new questions: not just does my code work? but how well does it work? and how elegant is my solution?\nBut here’s where it gets interesting: there are often many different recipes for chocolate chip cookies. Some are faster, some use fewer dishes, some produce chewier cookies, and some produce crispier ones. Similarly, for most computational problems, there are multiple valid solutions—and part of becoming a skilled programmer is learning to evaluate which solution is best for your particular situation.\n\nThe Flashlight Game: A Case Study in Efficiency\nLet’s make this concrete with an example. Imagine we’re in a lecture hall with 150 students, and we want to narrow the group down to just 10 people using yes/no questions. Each question works like this:\n\nA student poses a binary (yes/no) question\nEveryone who answers “yes” turns on their phone’s flashlight\nThose people are now “on vacation”—they’re done and can relax\nThe remaining people (who said “no”) continue playing\n\nThere’s a catch though: each question must eliminate at least 5 people but no more than half of the remaining group. These constraints force us to be strategic.\n\nAnalyzing the Best and Worst Cases\nLet’s think about this mathematically. We start with 150 people and want to get down to 10.\nBest case scenario: What if we’re really clever and each question eliminates exactly half the group?\n\nStart: 150 people\nAfter question 1: 75 people (eliminated 75)\nAfter question 2: 37-38 people (eliminated ~37)\nAfter question 3: 18-19 people (eliminated ~19)\nAfter question 4: 9-10 people (eliminated ~9)\n\nWe’re done in about 4 questions! Notice that we’re repeatedly dividing by 2, which is why we can express this mathematically as \\(\\log_2(150/10) \\approx 4\\) questions.\nWorst case scenario: What if we’re unlucky and can only eliminate the minimum (5 people) each round?\n\nWe need to eliminate 140 people total (150 - 10 = 140)\nEliminating 5 per round: 140 ÷ 5 = 28 rounds\n\nThat’s quite a difference! Same problem, same rules, but vastly different efficiency depending on our strategy.\n\n\nWhy Stop at 10?\nYou might wonder: why stop at 10 people instead of continuing until just one person remains? This reveals an important principle in algorithm design: once a problem becomes small enough, we can solve it by brute force.\nWith 10 people remaining, we could easily just go around the room and ask each person directly. The overhead of crafting clever binary questions isn’t worth it anymore. This principle—divide a large problem efficiently, then handle the small pieces directly—appears throughout computer science."

    "text": "Tangrams: The Power of Fundamental Building Blocks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTangrams are an ancient Chinese puzzle consisting of seven geometric pieces: five triangles (two large, one medium, two small), one square, and one parallelogram. These seven pieces can be rearranged to form an astonishing variety of shapes—animals, people, objects, abstract designs.\nThe beauty of tangrams is that the pieces never change. You’re not getting new pieces for each puzzle. Instead, you’re learning to see how the same fundamental components can be combined in different ways to solve different problems.\nThis is exactly how programming works.\nWhen you write Python code, you’re working with a relatively small set of fundamental building blocks:\n\nVariables to store information\nConditionals (if/else) to make decisions\nLoops (for/while) to repeat actions\nFunctions to organize and reuse code\nData structures (lists, dictionaries, sets) to organize information\n\nJust like tangram pieces, these building blocks don’t change. What changes is how you arrange them. A loop inside a conditional gives you different behavior than a conditional inside a loop. A function that calls another function creates different possibilities than two independent functions.\nThe journey of learning to program is partly about mastering these individual pieces, but more importantly, it’s about developing the intuition for how to combine them effectively. The more comfortable you become with the fundamental building blocks, the more sophisticated the problems you can solve. But what separates a working solution from a beautiful solution? Let’s explore that next."

    "section": "Elegance in Design and Code",
    "text": "Elegance in Design and Code\nWe’ve talked about combining fundamental building blocks to solve problems. Now let’s pause and consider a seemingly philosophical question: What makes something elegant?\nThis isn’t an idle question. In your previous coursework, you learned systematic approaches to design—how to reliably go from problem to solution. Now we’re adding another dimension: elegance—a quality we should actively pursue in our code, our algorithms, and our problem-solving approaches. You might not fully recognize it yet (that intuition develops with practice), but you can start to see what it looks like. So what does it mean?\n\nThe Scissors Test\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLook at these three examples of scissors:\n\nClassic scissors (left): Two handles, two blades, a simple pivot point. This design has remained virtually unchanged for thousands of years. Why? Because it perfectly embodies its function. Every element serves a purpose, and no element is wasted.\nMerged-handle scissors (center): Visually interesting, perhaps artistic, but completely non-functional. The handles are merged into one piece, making it impossible to open and close the blades. It fails the fundamental test of scissors: it cannot cut.\nColorful scissors (right): These add variety and personality through color, but notice that the underlying elegant design remains intact. The essential mechanism—the part that makes scissors work—is preserved.\n\nFrom these examples, we can extract what elegance means: form perfectly matched to function, with no unnecessary complexity.\n\n\nElegance in Computing\nIn the context of software development, elegance emerges from the intersection of two qualities:\nIngenuity — The problems we encounter are rarely solved by simply copying solutions we’ve seen before. We need creativity to adapt our tools to new challenges, to see unexpected connections, and to find novel approaches.\nSimplicity — Code is fundamentally a form of communication with other humans (your future self included!). If your solution is so complex that others cannot understand it, they will rewrite it rather than maintain it. Complexity creates friction; simplicity invites collaboration.\nSteve Jobs captured this beautifully:\n\n“Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication. It takes a lot of hard work to make something simple, to truly understand the underlying challenges and come up with elegant solutions. It’s not just minimalism or the absence of clutter. It involves digging through the depth of complexity. To be truly simple, you have to go really deep. You have to understand the essence of a product in order to be able to get rid of the parts that are not essential.”\n\nNotice that he says it takes “a lot of hard work” to make something simple. Simplicity isn’t about taking shortcuts or doing less thinking—it’s about thinking so clearly that you can strip away everything non-essential.\nWhen you write code, ask yourself:\n\nDoes each part serve a clear purpose? Like the pivot in scissors, every line of code should contribute to the solution.\nCan someone else understand what I’m doing? If not, can you simplify or add clarifying comments?\nAm I solving the problem, or am I showing off? Clever code is not always good code."

    "text": "Handcraft: A Bridge Between Art and Algorithm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTraditional handcrafts—quilting, knitting, crochet, weaving, paper art—might seem far removed from computer science, but they share deep structural similarities with programming. If you learned design processes in your intro course, think of handcraft as another lens on the same ideas: turning systematic instructions into creative artifacts. Understanding these connections can help us think more clearly about what we do when we write code.\nConsider what these crafts involve:\n\nPatterns: A quilt block is a pattern that repeats. A knitting stitch is a pattern that repeats. In programming, we call this iteration and loops.\nIngenuity: Working within constraints (limited yarn colors, fixed paper size) requires creativity. Same with programming.\nResource management: You have finite yarn, limited time. In computing, we have finite memory, limited processing power.\nInstructions: A knitting pattern is a sequence of instructions that, if followed precisely, produces a specific result. Sound familiar?\n\n\nKnitting Patterns as Algorithms\nLet’s look at an actual knitting pattern and see just how similar it is to code:\n\nHere’s a typical instruction: “Cast on 4 stitches. Row 1: Knit across. Row 2: Knit 1, yarn over, knit to end. Repeat Row 2 until you have 40 stitches.”\nLet’s translate this into programming concepts:\n# Cast on 4 stitches\nstitches = 4\n\n# Row 1: Knit across\nknit_row()\n\n# Repeat Row 2 until you have 40 stitches\nwhile stitches &lt; 40:\n    knit(1)\n    yarn_over()\n    knit_to_end()\n    stitches += 1\nThis isn’t just a superficial similarity—the structure of thought is identical. We have:\n\nInitialization: Setting up the initial state (casting on)\nSequence: Steps that happen in order\nIteration: Repeating actions (the loop)\nConditions: Knowing when to stop\n\nThe language of craft instructions and the language of programming are both trying to achieve the same thing: precise, unambiguous communication of a process."

    "section": "Quantifying Work: Understanding Growth",
    "text": "Quantifying Work: Understanding Growth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we come to one of the most important concepts in computer science: understanding how the amount of work grows as the problem size increases.\nLet’s stick with our knitting metaphor. Suppose you’re knitting a square dishcloth where each side has \\(n\\) stitches. How much total work (total stitches) do you need to do?\n\nA Simple Example\nLet’s try some concrete numbers:\n\nA \\(10 \\times 10\\) cloth has 10 rows, each with 10 stitches = \\(10 \\times 10 = 100\\) total stitches\nA \\(20 \\times 20\\) cloth has 20 rows, each with 20 stitches = \\(20 \\times 20 = 400\\) total stitches\nA \\(40 \\times 40\\) cloth has 40 rows, each with 40 stitches = \\(40 \\times 40 = 1,600\\) total stitches\nAn \\(80 \\times 80\\) cloth has 80 rows, each with 80 stitches = \\(80 \\times 80 = 6,400\\) total stitches\n\nNotice the pattern:\n\nWhen we doubled the size from 10 to 20, the work quadrupled (100 → 400)\nWhen we doubled again from 20 to 40, the work quadrupled again (400 → 1,600)\nWhen we doubled once more from 40 to 80, the work quadrupled once more (1,600 → 6,400)\n\nThis is what we mean when we say the work grows as \\(n^2\\) (pronounced “n squared”). The relationship between the size and the work isn’t linear—it’s quadratic.\n\n\nFrom Stitches to Code\nHere’s how we’d express this same idea in Python:\ndef knit_square_count(n):\n    stitches = 0\n    for row in range(n):          # n rows\n        for col in range(n):      # n stitches per row\n            stitches += 1         # one unit of work\n    return stitches               # total = n × n = n²\nLet’s break down why this is \\(n^2\\):\n\nThe outer loop runs \\(n\\) times (once for each row)\nFor each iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop runs \\(n\\) times (once for each stitch in that row)\nThe line stitches += 1 executes \\(n \\times n = n^2\\) times total\n\nThe nested loop structure directly corresponds to the mathematical relationship. One loop gives you linear growth (\\(n\\)), two nested loops give you quadratic growth (\\(n^2\\)), three nested loops would give you cubic growth (\\(n^3\\)), and so on.\n\n\nWhy This Matters: Making it Visual\nWe could also write this function to actually show the square being built:\ndef knit_square_print(n):\n    for row in range(n):\n        current_row = \"\"\n        for col in range(n):\n            current_row += \"X\"\n        print(current_row)\nIf you call knit_square_print(5), you’ll see:\nXXXXX\nXXXXX\nXXXXX\nXXXXX\nXXXXX\nEach X represents one “unit of work.” Counting the X’s gives you the total work: \\(5^2 = 25\\) operations."

    "text": "The Mathematics of Efficiency\nNow let’s connect this to computer science more broadly. When we analyze algorithms, we ask: “As the input size grows, how does the running time grow?”\nThis question leads us to mathematical functions that describe growth rates. The most common ones you’ll encounter are:\n\n\\(n\\) (linear): Work grows directly with input size\n\nExample: Reading through a list once\n\n\\(n \\log n\\) (log-linear): Slightly more than linear\n\nExample: Efficient sorting algorithms like mergesort\n\n\\(n^2\\) (quadratic): Work grows with the square of input size\n\nExample: Comparing every pair of items in a list\n\n\\(n^3\\) (cubic): Work grows with the cube of input size\n\nExample: Comparing every triple of items\n\n\\(2^n\\) (exponential): Work doubles with each additional input\n\nExample: Trying every possible subset of items\n\n\n\nA Dramatic Illustration\nLet’s imagine we have a computer that can perform \\(10^{12}\\) (one trillion) operations per second. This is roughly comparable to modern high-performance hardware. How long would different algorithms take?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nn = 10\nn = 100\nn = 1,000\nn = 10,000\nn = 1012\n\n\n\n\n\\(n\\)\n10-11 s\n10-10 s\n10-9 s\n10-8 s\n1 s\n\n\n\\(n \\log n\\)\n10-11 s\n10-9 s\n10-8 s\n10-7 s\n40 s\n\n\n\\(n^2\\)\n10-10 s\n10-8 s\n10-6 s\n10-4 s\n1012 s\n\n\n\\(n^3\\)\n10-9 s\n10-6 s\n10-3 s\n1 s\n1024 s\n\n\n\\(2^n\\)\n10-9 s\n1018 s\n10289 s\n—\n—\n\n\n\nLet’s put those big numbers in perspective:\n\n\\(n^2\\) with a trillion items: \\(10^{12}\\) seconds ≈ 32,000 years. Civilization as we know it hasn’t existed that long.\n\\(n^3\\) with a trillion items: \\(10^{24}\\) seconds ≈ longer than the universe has existed. This is meaningless to wait for.\n\\(2^n\\) with just 100 items: \\(10^{18}\\) seconds ≈ a billion years. Our sun will have died long before this completes.\n\nFor small inputs (like \\(n = 10\\)), everything is so fast that efficiency doesn’t matter. But as problems scale—and modern problems do scale to billions or trillions of items—the growth rate becomes absolutely critical.\nThis is why we care so much about algorithmic efficiency. An elegant, efficient algorithm isn’t just intellectually satisfying—it can mean the difference between a problem that completes in seconds versus one that would outlive civilizations.\nDon’t worry if this feels like a lot to absorb at once—these ideas will recur throughout the term. Every time we analyze an algorithm, we’ll ask: what’s the growth rate? By the end of the course, this kind of analysis will feel second nature. For now, the key takeaway is simple: the structure of our loops and the growth rate of our algorithms have real, dramatic consequences.\n\n\nUnderstanding What \\(n\\) Represents\nIt’s important to note that “\\(n\\)” is a variable that represents the “size” of your input, but what that means depends on the problem:\n\nFor searching through a list, \\(n\\) might be the number of items in the list\nFor our knitting example, \\(n\\) represents the side length of the square\nFor processing an image, \\(n\\) might be the number of pixels\nFor analyzing social networks, \\(n\\) might be the number of people\n\nThe key insight is always the same: how does the work scale as this size parameter increases?"

It’s deeply personal, but it’s also culturally loaded in ways we don’t always notice:\n\nRed  means luck and celebration in Chinese culture… but danger and warning in Western contexts. Same colour, totally different vibes!\nWhite  symbolizes purity and weddings in many Western traditions… but mourning and funerals in some Eastern cultures. Imagine the confusion at an international wedding!\nPurple  was once the colour of royalty (because the dye was ridiculously expensive)… but has taken on completely different meanings today.\n\nThese associations aren’t random—they’re woven into centuries of art, literature, religion, and daily life.

    "text": "How Computers “See” Colour\nSpoiler alert: they don’t. Not really. But we’ve found a clever workaround.\n\nIt All Starts with Electricity\nLet’s go all the way down to the bottom. Inside your computer, everything—and I mean everything—comes down to electrical charges.\n\n\n\nClose-up of a solid-state drive (SSD) circuit board. All data—including your favorite cat photos and every colour in them—is ultimately stored as electrical charges in chips like these. Wild, right?\n\n\nSee those chips? They’re full of tiny transistors holding or releasing electrons, creating regions of positive and negative charge. Your computer interprets these charges as bits: binary digits that can be either 0 or 1.\nThat’s it. Just two states. On or off. Yes or no. One or zero.\nIs that really enough to represent… everything? 🤔\n\n\nFrom Bits to Numbers (It’s Just Counting!)\nHere’s where it gets fun. You already know how to count in base 10:\n\n\n\n3\n1\n5\n7\n\n\n\n\n3 × 10³\n1 × 10²\n5 × 10¹\n7 × 10⁰\n\n\n3000\n100\n50\n7\n\n\n\nThe number 3157 is just: three thousands, one hundred, five tens, and seven ones.\nNow here’s the trick—we can do exactly the same thing in base 2:\n\n\n\n1\n0\n1\n1\n\n\n\n\n1 × 2³\n0 × 2²\n1 × 2¹\n1 × 2⁰\n\n\n8\n0\n2\n1\n\n\n\nSo 1011 in binary = 8 + 0 + 2 + 1 = 11 in decimal.\nPop quiz! 🎯\n\nWhat’s the highest number you can make with 4 bits?\nWhat about 5 bits?\n\n(Think about it before scrolling…)\nWith 4 bits: 1111 = 8+4+2+1 = 15 (that’s \\(2^4 - 1\\), or 16 possible values: 0 through 15)\nWith 5 bits: 11111 = 31 (that’s \\(2^5 - 1\\), or 32 possible values)\nIn general, \\(n\\) bits gives you \\(2^n\\) different values. Math is cool. 😎\n\n\nFrom Numbers to Colours: RGB\nOkay, so we can represent numbers with bits. But how do we get from numbers to colours?\nWe just… agree on a system! The most common one is RGB: Red, Green, Blue.\nEach colour component gets a number from 0 to 255. (Why 255? Because that’s exactly \\(2^8 - 1\\)—the range of an 8-bit number. Everything connects!)\nCheck it out:\n\n(255, 0, 0) = pure red  (max red, no green, no blue)\n(0, 255, 0) = pure green \n(0, 0, 255) = pure blue \n(255, 255, 0) = yellow  (red + green, no blue—try it!)\n(255, 0, 127) = a lovely pink \n\nBy mixing different amounts of red, green, and blue light, we can create…\n$256 = $ 16,777,216 different colours! 🌈\nThat’s more colours than most humans can distinguish. Not bad for a bunch of 1s and 0s!\n\n\nHexadecimal: Because Programmers Are Lazy (In a Good Way)\nWriting (103, 78, 167) every time you want a specific purple is tedious. And writing the binary version?\n0110 0111 0100 1110 1010 0111\nUgh. Nobody wants that.\nEnter hexadecimal (base 16). Instead of 10 digits, we use 16: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 a b c d e f\nThe magic: each hex digit represents exactly 4 bits. So we can write any colour in just 6 characters:\n0110 0111 0100 1110 1010 0111  (binary - 24 digits 😫)\n   6    7    4    e    a    7  (hex - 6 characters 😊)\nWhich we write as: #674ea7 \nYou’ve probably seen hex codes in web design, CSS, or design tools. Now you know what they actually mean!\n🎨 Want to play? Check out https://colorizer.org and try converting between RGB and hex. It’s weirdly satisfying."

    "text": "Diversion: The Geometry of Odd Numbers\nHere’s a cute mathematical puzzle we explored in class. It turns out that adding odd numbers reveals beautiful geometric patterns!\n\nBuilding Squares from Odd Numbers\n\n\n\nBuilding squares from odd numbers: 1, then 1+3=4, then 1+3+5=9.\n\n\nDo you see the pattern? Each odd number forms an “L-shape” that wraps around the previous square to make the next bigger square!\n1 + 3 + 5 + …\nThe sum of the first \\(k\\) odd numbers is \\(k^2\\).\n\n\nHow Many Terms? Finding k\nBut wait—if someone gives you \\(1 + 3 + 5 + \\ldots + 2381\\), how do you know how many terms that is?\n\n\n\nThe k-th odd number is 2k−1, so we can work backwards to find k.\n\n\nThe k-th odd number is \\(2k - 1\\). So if the last term is \\(2k - 1\\), then:\n\\[k = \\frac{\\text{last} + 1}{2}\\]\nThat’s why \\(1 + 3 + 5 + \\ldots + 1337 = 669^2 = 447561\\). (Since \\(k = (1337+1)/2 = 669\\).)\n\n\nSums of Partial Sequences: Inclusion-Exclusion\nWhat about \\(11 + 13 + 15 + \\ldots + 23\\)?\nThink geometrically! This is like taking a 12×12 square (sum of first 12 odds, ending at 23) and removing a 5×5 square (sum of first 5 odds, ending at 9):\n\n\n\nThe 5×5 square sits in a corner of the 12×12, showing exactly which squares are subtracted.\n\n\nThe sum of odd numbers from \\((2j+1)\\) to \\((2k-1)\\) is \\(k^2 - j^2\\).\nThis is inclusion-exclusion in action: take the big square, subtract the small one!\n\n\nWhat About Even Numbers?\nHere’s a neat trick: every even number is just an odd number plus one! So we can regroup:\n\\[2 + 4 + \\ldots + 24 = (1+1) + (3+1) + \\ldots + (23+1)\\]\n\\[= \\underbrace{1 + 3 + \\ldots + 23}_{12 \\text{ odds}} + \\underbrace{1 + 1 + \\ldots + 1}_{12 \\text{ ones}} = 12^2 + 12\\]\n\n\n\nThe sum of evens is the sum of odds plus k extra ones.\n\n\nIn general, the sum of the first \\(k\\) evens = sum of the first \\(k\\) odds + \\(k\\):\n\\[2 + 4 + 6 + \\ldots + 2k = k^2 + k = k(k+1)\\]\nFor example: \\(2 + 4 + 6 + \\ldots + 1338 = 669 \\times 670 = 448230\\).\n\n\nWhy Does This Matter?\nThese patterns show up everywhere in computer science:\n\nLoop analysis: When you have nested loops, you’re often summing arithmetic sequences\nAlgorithm complexity: Many \\(O(n^2)\\) algorithms have this structure hiding inside\nGeometric reasoning: Sometimes the fastest way to understand a formula is to draw it\n\nPlus, it’s just satisfying when math has pictures! 🎨\n\nPhoto credit: Poppy field from Epic Gardening.

Following the instructions below will help you install and configure the tech stack correctly in the same way for our course, enabling us to support you effectively and minimize setup issues and software conflicts.\n\n\n\nWindowsmacOS\n\n\n In all the sections below, if you are presented with the choice to download either a 64-bit (also called x64) or a 32-bit (also called x86) version of the application always choose the 64-bit version.\n\n\nIn all the sections below, if you are presented with the choice to download either a 64-bit (also called x64) or a 32-bit (also called x86) version of the application always choose the 64-bit version. If you purchased a Mac anytime in the last few years, chances are you have an “M1/M2/M3/M4”… Mac, also known as “Apple Silicon”, and “arm64”. When given the option, you should choose to download the “arm64”/Apple Silicon or the “Universal versions—if that choice doesn’t exist, then you can choose the”x86” version which will run in “emulated mode”, which will result in a slight performance penalty.\n\n\n\n\n\nOperating system (OS)\nWe strongly suggest to run the latest version of the operating system (OS) available for your laptop.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nIf you update or upgrade your OS you do so on your own risk!\n\n\nIn general, there are many good reasons to update your OS. Some of the software tools or their functionality used in our tutorials will only work on more recent OS versions. Updating your OS will also ensure that you have the latest security updates installed and help prevent unauthorized access to your computer.\nThere a two main reasons that would prevent you from updating your OS:\n\nYour hardware would not support the updated OS.\nSome of your software you depend on might not work on a newer OS.\n\n\nWindowsmacOS\n\n\nThe latest version of Windows 11 available is 24H2 (build 26100.6584). See here on how to update your Windows 11 machine to the latest version. If you do not own Windows 11, currently enrolled UBC students with a valid CWL account qualify for one license of Windows 11 Education.\n\n\nThe latest version of macOS is Tahoe 16.0. Check your current version of macOS. If you do not have the latest version, follow the upgrade instructions on the Apple support page.\nIf you cannot upgrade to the latest version, follow these instructions to find the system requirements and upgrade to latest versions available to you. If you need to maintain 32-bit compatibility for any of your software, then upgrade to no higher than macOS 10.14 Mojave.\n\n\n\n\n\nTerminal\nA terminal program allows you to interact with many different programs using a command line interface. Instead of using graphical elements like in a graphical user interface, you type in commands describing what program you want to use and how you want to use it.\n\nWindowsmacOS\n\n\nThe terminal app Terminal comes preinstalled with Windows. Activate the Windows Start menu, start typing “terminal” and select the Terminal app by pressing EnterEnter.\n\n\nThe terminal app Terminal comes preinstalled with macOS. Activate Spotlight with Command-SpaceCommand-Space, start typing “terminal” and select the Terminal app by pressing EnterEnter.\n\n\n\nYou will need to open the terminal several times in these instructions to install other programs.\n\n\nPackage manager\nA package manager is a program allowing you to install and update programs on your computer, similar to the Microsoft Store on Windows or the App Store on macOS. The main difference of a package manager to these programs is that you use them with a command line interface running in a terminal instead of a graphical user interface.\n\nWindowsmacOS\n\n\nIf you have at least Windows 10 version 1809 (build 17763) or later installed on your machine, you will already have the package manager WinGet available to you. When you use WinGet for the first time, you will be asked to register the Windows Package Manager with the Microsoft Store.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIf you cannot update your Windows to a version that supports WinGet, please reach out to the teaching team.\n\n\n\nResources\n\nUse WinGet to install and manage applications\n\n\n\n\nWe will use one of the most popular package managers on macOS called Homebrew. Open your Terminal, and then enter the following command:\n/bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\"\nYou will be asked to enter the password for your computer:\n==&gt; Checking for `sudo` access (which may request your password)...\nEnter your password (it is normal that the cursor will not move as you enter characters for a password) and hit EnterEnter.\nNext, the installation will install the XCode Command Line Tools:\nThe XCode Command Line Tools will be installed.\nA new window will open with the following prompt:\n\nThe “xcode-select” command requires the command line developer tools. Would you like to install the tools now?\nChoose Install to download and install the command line developer tools now.” Confirm by clicking on “Install”.\n\nAfterwards, back in the terminal, you will be informed what steps will be executed:\n==&gt; This script will install:\n/opt/homebrew/bin/brew\n/opt/homebrew/share/doc/homebrew\n/opt/homebrew/share/man/man1/brew.1\n/opt/homebrew/share/zsh/site-functions/_brew\n/opt/homebrew/etc/bash_completion.d/brew\n/opt/homebrew\n/etc/paths.d/homebrew\n\nPress RETURN/ENTER to continue or any other key to abort:\nConfirm with EnterEnter. When the installation is finished, you will be asked to run the following command in the terminal to add Homebrew to your PATH:\necho &gt;&gt; \"${HOME}/.zprofile\"\necho 'eval \"$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)\"' &gt;&gt; \"${HOME}/.zprofile\"\neval \"$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)\"\nNow test if Homebrew works:\nbrew --version\nYou should see the following:\nHomebrew 4.6.11\n\nResources\n\nHomebrew Documentation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPython\n\nInstalling uv\nWe will be using Python for a large part of the course, and uv will be our Python package manager. Instead of installing Python separately on our machine, we will use uv to provision us with Python whenever we need to run it.\n\nWindowsmacOS\n\n\nIn the terminal, install uv with Winget:\nwinget install -e --id=astral-sh.uv\n\n\nIn the terminal install uv with Homebrew:\nbrew install uv\n\n\n\nTo check if uv installed successfully, type in the terminal:\nuv --version\nAnd you should see something like this\nuv 0.8.18 &lt;some-installer-specific-information&gt;\n\nResources\n\nInstallation | uv\n\n\n\n\nmarimo\nWe will be writing our code in a notebook app called marimo. marimo is itself a Python package, so we can use uv to install and run it. In particular, we will use the command uvx which will check if we have the latest version of marimo and everything else necessary to run it, even Python itself!\nuvx marimo --version\nAnd you should see:\n0.16.0\nEven better, try this:\nuvx marimo tutorial intro\nAnd your default browser should open a window showing marimo.\n\nFor now, let’s shut down marimo by clicking on the red x in the top right corner and then on the “Shutdown” button.\nNow you are ready to run Python code on your local machine!!!\n\nResources\n\nInstallation | marimo",

    "section": "Optional software",
    "text": "Optional software\nIf you are interested in using a very common software development tool and platform for version control, check out Git and GitHub. We also have two examples with Zoom or your web browser on how to install and update everyday software with a package manager.\n\nGit and GitHub\nWe will be using the command line version of Git.\n\nWindowsmacOS\n\n\nGit is installed as part of Git Bash. Open your terminal, and install Git Bash with\nwinget install -e --id Git.Git\nRestart your terminal.\n\n\nOpen your terminal, and install Git with:\nbrew install git\n\n\n\nIn the terminal, type the following to check the Git version:\ngit --version\nYou should see something like this if everything is working correctly:\ngit version 2.51.0\n\nGitHub.com account\nSign up for a free account at GitHub.com if you don’t have one already. Your GitHub.com username is important, so here some advice on picking a username and below an image on how to find it again.\n\n\n\nConfiguring Git user info\nNext, we need to configure Git by telling it your name and email. To do this, provide your name and GitHub email by typing into the terminal:\ngit config --global user.name \"&lt;your-name&gt;\"\ngit config --global user.email \"&lt;your-github-email&gt;\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nTo ensure that you haven’t made a typo in any of the above, you can view your global Git configurations by either opening the configuration file in a text editor (e.g., via the command code ~/.gitconfig) or by typing git config --list --global. You can quit this view by just pressing the q key on your keyboard.\n\n\n\n\nCreate your GitHub “Personal Access Token”\nThis is a bit tricky, so please make sure you follow these directions carefully.\n\nStart creating a personal access token (PAT) on GitHub.com either by\n\nClicking this link: https://github.com/settings/tokens/new\nNavigating to your tokens by following these steps:\n\nLog in to GitHub.com\nClick your picture in the top right and select “Settings”\nClick on “Developer Settings”\nClick on “Personal access tokens” and then on “Tokens (classic)”\nClick “Generate new token”\n\n\nGive the token a name in the note field, for example, CPSC 203\nChoose for expiration “Custom” and set the date to the end of this term: 2026-04-10\nSet the scope of the token to the “repo” level (see image below):\n\n\n\nPersonal access token settings\n\n\nClick “Generate new token”\nCopy the token that is shown to you. It is essentially a password for apps on your computer (for example, Git) to enable them to take actions on GitHub.com for you (in this case, clone a private repository to your computer). Treat this password like any other of your other passwords, so don’t share your token with anyone.\nSave this token somewhere safe on your computer, such as a password manager. You will not be able to come back to this page to get your token. If you forget or lose a token, you can just delete that token on GitHub.com where you manage all existing tokens and create another one: https://github.com/settings/tokens\n\n\n\n\nClone your first repository on your computer\nOpen the terminal, and then run the following command:\ngit clone https://github.com/firasm/test.git\nHopefully, if things work, you should be able to see a new folder created at that location. We will be talking more about what exactly you did over the next week and a bit, don’t worry!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIf after running the code above, you see the error message:\nfatal: destination path 'test' already exists and is not an empty directory. \nIt means that you already attempted a clone before, and there is already a directory called test where you are trying to clone this repository. You will first need to delete that directory to try again. Open an Explorer (Windows) or Finder (macOS) window on your computer, navigate to the directory, right click the test directory and delete it. Alternatively, from the command line you can try:\nrm -rf test\nwhich will “remove” (using the rm command) the directory called test. The- is to specify additional options: r means “recursively” for all the files in the directory, and f means “force” which means don’t ask me for confirmation after deleting each file and folder.\n\n\n\n\n\nZoom\nSo far, we have been using the package manager to install software development tools. We can use the package manager to install other everyday software making it easier to find the correct version for your hardware or update to the latest release. For example, you might attend office hours or a livestream using Zoom Workplace and you should install the Zoom client locally on your machine.\n\nWindowsmacOS\n\n\nIn your terminal, use WinGet to install Zoom:\nwinget install -e --id Zoom.Zoom\n\n\nIn your terminal, use Homebrew to install Zoom:\nbrew install --cask zoom\n\n\n\nIt is important that you have the most recent version of Zoom installed, as we will be using many of the features that are only available in more recent versions. The latest version of Zoom is 6.6.0 (64511). For a lot of software, there is an option to check for updates.\n\nA package manager can directly update any software you have installed with it.\n\nWindowsmacOS\n\n\nwinget upgrade -e --id Zoom.Zoom\n\n\nbrew upgrade --cask zoom\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nPlease note that if you have been relying on the “web version” of Zoom that works only in a browser, this will not work for this course! Please make sure to download the Zoom desktop client for your operating system to fully participate in the course.\n\n\n\n\nWeb browser\nYou are welcome to use most modern browsers that have a WebKit or Gecko backend. Safari (Mac only), Firefox, Vivaldi, Brave, Edge are all recommended. Google Chrome is not recommended because of the well-documented privacy and tracking issues with Google.\nOptional: try to install the browser also with the package manager! Use this website to find the install instruction for the browser of your choice:\n\nWindowsmacOS\n\n\nwinget.run | Finding winget packages made simple.\n\n\nHomebrew Formulae",

All sessions are recorded and posted, but we make no guarantees about the quality of the recording, nor do we try very hard to replicate the in-class experience for online participants.\nLab – The material presented in the weekly lab is more detailed and more applied than the classroom narrative. It is an opportunity for you to make sure you can DO the things we talk about in class. Lab exercises are presented in physical class meetings where you will work in groups to complete PrairieLearn assessments. There are ~10 over the term, beginning in week 2.\nExamlets – Five self-scheduled 50 minute assessments to be completed on PrairieLearn in the Computer Based Testing Facility (CBTF). You will be given ample practice materials to use in preparation for the examlets. Examlet questions will be a mix of coding and conceptual questions.\nProjects – Most of the coding in the course will occur within three significan coding projects. Though we place no constraints on your use of outside resources for completing these exercises, all of the algorithms and problem solving they contain may appear on examlets.\nFinal Exam – Like the examlets, the final exam will be self-scheduled within the CBTF. The exam window – approximately 5 days – will be posted later in the term.",

Licensors should read and understand the terms\n and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.\n Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before\n applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the\n material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any\n material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-\n licensed material, or material used under an exception or\n limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:\nwiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors\n\n Considerations for the public: By using one of our public\n licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the\n licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If\n the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for\n example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to\n copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license.

Quick and decided in her ways, Emma lost no time in inviting, encouraging, and telling her to come very often; and as their acquaintance increased, so did their satisfaction in each other. As a walking companion, Emma had very early foreseen how useful she might find her. In that respect Mrs. Weston’s loss had been important. Her father never went beyond the shrubbery, where two divisions of the ground sufficed him for his long walk, or his short, as the year varied; and since Mrs. Weston’s marriage her exercise had been too much confined. She had ventured once alone to Randalls, but it was not pleasant; and a Harriet Smith, therefore, one whom she could summon at any time to a walk, would be a valuable addition to her privileges. But in every respect, as she saw more of her, she approved her, and was confirmed in all her kind designs.\nTypical categories of entities are PERSON, LOCATION, ORGANIZATION. Think about how you might discover each of the entities using a program."

Read it as: “Given a row, look up the place name in row['errand'],geocode it, and return the (lat, lon).”\nThe returned value becomes the entry in the new latlong column.\n\nWhy lambda?

We continue our exploration of the idea of elegance, making connections to problem solving and code. Then, we learn a mechanism for measuring efficiency, and talk briefly about why it’s important to consider. The discussion about efficiency is followed by a diversion into color representation. Finally, we look at some code! The day concludes with a sequence of Python examples designed to clear the cobwebs on lists – our first data structure!"
