### Package manager

A package manager is a program allowing you to install and update programs on your computer, similar to the Microsoft Store on Windows or the App Store on macOS.
The main difference of a package manager to these programs is that you use them with a command line interface running in a terminal instead of a graphical user interface.

## Windows

If you have at least Windows 10 version 1809 (build 17763) or later installed on your machine, you will already have the package manager *WinGet* available to you.
When you use WinGet for the first time, you will be asked to register the Windows Package Manager with the Microsoft Store.

If you cannot update your Windows to a version that supports WinGet, please reach out to the teaching team.

## macOS

We will use one of the most popular package managers on macOS called *Homebrew*.
Open your Terminal, and then enter the following command:

``` bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

You will be asked to enter the password for your computer:

```         
==> Checking for `sudo` access (which may request your password)...
```

Enter your password (it is normal that the cursor will not move as you enter characters for a password) and hit {{< kbd Enter >}}.

Next, the installation will install the *XCode Command Line Tools*:

```         
The XCode Command Line Tools will be installed.
```

A new window will open with the following prompt:

> **The "xcode-select" command requires the command line developer tools. Would you like to install the tools now?**
>
> Choose Install to download and install the command line developer tools now." Confirm by clicking on "Install".

Afterwards, back in the terminal, you will be informed what steps will be executed:

```         
==> This script will install:
/opt/homebrew/bin/brew
/opt/homebrew/share/doc/homebrew
/opt/homebrew/share/man/man1/brew.1
/opt/homebrew/share/zsh/site-functions/_brew
/opt/homebrew/etc/bash_completion.d/brew
/opt/homebrew
/etc/paths.d/homebrew

Press RETURN/ENTER to continue or any other key to abort:
```

Confirm with {{< kbd Enter >}}.
When the installation is finished, you will be asked to run the following command in the terminal to add Homebrew to your `PATH`:

``` bash
echo >> /Users/stephankoenig/.zprofile
echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> /Users/stephankoenig/.zprofile
eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
```

Now test if Homebrew works:

``` bash
brew --version
```

You should see the following:

```         
Homebrew {{< var software.brew >}}
```
