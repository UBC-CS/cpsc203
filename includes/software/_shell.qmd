### Terminal {#terminal}

## Windows

Unfortunately, one of the major problems with using the Windows operating system is that the "Command Prompt" that comes with the operating system is severely deficient.
No worries though, luckily most of the tools we use in this course are open source, so the community has worked hard to shore up deficiencies in the Microsoft ecosystem.

A very common tool found on Unix-like systems (like macOS and Linux distirbutions), is called bash, and the best way to make it available to Widows is to install Linux. Luckily, there is a tool that allows us to run Linux alongside Windows (as something called a virtual machine) called Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). To set it up, we first start the Windows Terminal by opening the Windows Start menu, typing "terminal" in search bar and opening it. The Terminal will open in something called PowerShell:

```
Windows PowerShell
Copyright (C) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.

Install the latest PowerShell for new features and improvements! https://aka.ms/PSWindows

PS C:\Users\<user-name>>
```

Now type the following to install Ubuntu via WSL:

``` powershell
wsl --install
```

After the install <do we need to start Ubuntu manually?>, you will be prompted to create a username and password for Ubuntu, keep this information in a safe place like a password manager.

If you encounter any problems, reach out on Giscus to us.

The replacement for the Command Prompt we will use in this course is called "Git BASH".
The latest version of Git BASH for Windows is {{< var software.git >}}.

::: callout-important
"Git BASH" is relatively old software, but it is very reliable and works very well.
If you are feeling brave and want to setup `zsh` (the next generation shell, with many improvements) on Windows, you can [try these instructions here](https://dev.to/zinox9/installing-zsh-on-windows-37em).
Note that these instructions are experimental and support from the teaching team is limited.
But if you can get it to work or run into any issues, let me know!
I hope to adopt zsh on windows fully next time I teach this course.
:::

Briefly, we will be using the Bash shell to interact with our computers via a command line interface, and Git to keep a version history of our files and upload to/download from to GitHub.

[Download the windows version of Git BASH](https://git-scm.com/download/win), run the installer and **accept the default configuration for all pages except for the following**:

-   On the **Choosing the default editor used by Git** page, select "Use Visual Studio Code as Git's default editor" from the drop-down menu.
-   *Optional*: On the **Select Components** page, check "On the Desktop" under "Additional icons" to create a shortcut for Git BASH on your Desktop.

![](/images/vscode-as-git-editor.png){fig-alt="Choosing 'Use Visual Studio Code as Git's default editor' from the drop-down menu"}

::: callout-note
If you wish to pin Git BASH to the taskbar, you need to search for the program in the start menu, right click the entry and select "Pin to taskbar".
If you instead first launch the program and pin it by right clicking on the taskbar icon, Git BASH will open with the wrong home directory (`/` instead of `/c/users/$USERNAME`.
:::

::: callout-note
After installation, test if you were successful by opening the Git BASH program.

![](/images/git-bash.png){fig-alt="Git BASH icon on the Desktop and an open instance of Git BASH."}

Going forward we will refer Git BASH just as the "terminal" and all commands should be entered there (not Anaconda Command Prompt, Command Prompt or PowerShell, etc.).
:::

In the terminal, type the following to check which version of Bash you just installed:

``` bash
bash --version
```

The output should look similar to this:

```         
GNU bash, version {{< var software.bash >}}-release (x86_64-pc-sys)
Copyright (C) {{< var software.bash-year >}} Free Software Foundation, Inc.
License GPLv3+: GNU GPL version 3 or later <http://gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html>

There is NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by law.
```

::: callout-tip
If you tried to paste the above into Git BASH, you will have noticed that {{< kbd Control-V >}} does not work in Git BASH. Instead you need to right click and select "Paste" or use the {{< kbd Shift-Insert >}} shortcut.
To copy from the Git BASH terminal you simply select the text you want and it is copied automatically.
:::

::: callout-tip
Via right click you can also reach the settings menu where you can configure Git BASH to your preferences, a couple of tips would be to check "Mouse \> Clicks place command line cursor" and change the font to something more legible, e.g.
Consolas ("Text \> Select").

#### Launch VS Code from Git BASH

You can launch many windows programs from the Bash terminal, e.g. to launch VS Code that we installed previously, you would type in `code`, let's use this to check the version of vscode that we installed:

``` bash
code --version
```

```         
1.71
e4503b30fc78200f846c62cf8091b76ff5547662
x64
```

#### Setting VS Code as the default editor

To make programs run from the terminal (such as `git`) use VS Code by default, we will modify `~/.bash_profile`.
First, open this file using VS Code by typing into the terminal:

``` bash
code ~/.bash_profile
```

::: callout-note
If you see any existing lines in your `~/.bash_profile` related to a previous Python or R installation, please remove these.
:::

{{< contents set-terminal-editor >}}

## macOS

You can proceed to spice up your terminal a bit!

#### Oh My Zsh to configure the terminal

Install "Oh My Zsh" to add terminal colours, highlighting and other cool features by running the following command in your terminal:

``` bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

You may now customize your terminal with themes (see [screenshots of themes here](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Themes)) by [following the directions here](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh#selecting-a-theme).
Selecting a theme is optional, the default one is pretty good as it is!

#### Configure VS Code to launch from the terminal

1.  Launch VS Code
2.  Open the Command Palette {{< kbd Shift-Command-P >}}
3.  Type `shell command` to find the "Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH" command
4.  Hit {{< kbd Enter >}}
5.  Restart the terminal for the new `$PATH` value to take effect

Now you can open files in VS Code from the terminal!
Alternatively, just type `code .` in any folder to start editing files in that folder.

You can test that VS Code is installed and can be opened from terminal by restarting Terminal and typing the following command in a Terminal:

``` bash
code --version
```

you should see something like this if you were successful:

```         
1.85.2
8b3775030ed1a69b13e4f4c628c612102e30a681
arm64
```

If this does **not** work for you, try it again:

1.  Restart VS Code.
2.  Open the Command Palette {{< kbd Shift-Command-P >}}.
3.  Type `shell command` to find the "Shell Command: Uninstall 'code' command from PATH".
4.  Hit Enter.
5.  Type `shell command` to find the "Shell Command: Install 'code' command from PATH".
6.  You might need to enter in your Mac's admin password.

If this *still* does not work, then you should ask a TA for help, but if you're feeling brave, [manual install instructions are here - remember to use the `zsh` files](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac#_launching-from-the-command-line) steps as well.

#### Setting VS Code as the default editor

To make programs run from the Terminal (such as `git`) use VS Code by default, we will modify `~/.z_profile`.
First, open it using VS Code:

``` bash
code ~/.z_profile
```

::: callout-note
If you see any existing lines in your `~/.z_profile` related to a previous Python installation, please remove them.
:::

{{< contents set-terminal-editor >}}
::::

````{=html}
<!--
Quarto content divs (https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/contents.html)
-->
````

:::: {#set-terminal-editor}
Append the following lines:

``` bash
# Set the default editor for programs launch from terminal
EDITOR="code --wait"
VISUAL=$EDITOR  # Use the same value as for "EDITOR" in the line above
```

Then save the file and exit VS Code.

::: callout-note
Most terminal programs will read the `EDITOR` environmental variable when determining which editor to use, but some read `VISUAL`, so we're setting both to the same value.
