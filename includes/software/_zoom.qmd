### Zoom

So far, we have been using the package manager to install software development tools.
We can use the package manager to install other everyday software making it easier to find the correct version for your hardware or update to the latest release.
For example, you might attend office hours or a livestream using *Zoom Workplace* and you should install the Zoom client locally on your machine.

::: {.panel-tabset group="os"}
## Windows

In your terminal, use WinGet to install Zoom:

```powershell
winget install -e --id Zoom.Zoom
```

## macOS

In your terminal, use Homebrew to install Zoom:

``` bash
brew install --cask zoom
```
:::

It is important that you have the most recent version of Zoom installed, as we will be using many of the features that are only available in more recent versions.
The latest version of Zoom is {{< var software.zoom >}}.
For a lot of software, there is an option to check for updates.

A package manager can directly update any software you have installed with it.

::: {.panel-tabset group="os"}
## Windows

```powershell
winget upgrade -e --id Zoom.Zoom
```

## macOS

``` bash
brew upgrade --cask zoom
```

Please note that if you have been relying on the "web version" of Zoom that works only in a browser, this will not work for this course!
Please make sure to download the Zoom desktop client for your operating system to fully participate in the course.
