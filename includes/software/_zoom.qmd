### Zoom

We will be using Zoom in this course for all the student hours and you should install the Zoom client locally on your machine.
It is important that you have the most recent version of Zoom installed, as we will be using many of the features that are only available in more recent versions.

The latest version of Zoom is {{< var software.zoom >}}.
You can ensure you have the latest version of Zoom by clicking "Check for Updates" as shown in the screenshot below.

Please note that if you have been relying on the "web version" of Zoom that works only in a browser, this will not work for this course!
Please make sure to download the Zoom desktop client for your operating system to fully participate in the course.
