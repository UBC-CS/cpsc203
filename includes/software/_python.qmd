### Python

#### Installing `uv`

We will be using Python for a large part of the course, and *uv* will be our Python package manager.
Instead of installing Python separately on our machine, we will use `uv` to provision us with Python whenever we need to run it.

## Windows

In the terminal, install `uv` with Winget:

``` powershell
winget install -e --id=astral-sh.uv
```

## macOS

In the terminal install `uv` with Homebrew:

``` bash
brew install uv
```
:::

To check if uv installed successfully, type in the terminal:

``` bash
uv --version
```

And you should see something like this

```         
uv {{< var software.uv >}} <some-installer-specific-information>
```

#### marimo

We will be writing our code in a notebook app called *marimo*.
marimo is itself a Python package, so we can use `uv` to install and run it.
In particular, we will use the command `uvx` which will check if we have the latest version of marimo and everything else necessary to run it, even Python itself!

``` bash
uvx marimo --version
```

And you should see:

```         
{{< var software.marimo >}}
```

Even better, try this:

``` bash
uvx marimo tutorial intro
```

And your default browser should open a window showing marimo.

For now, let's shut down marimo by clicking on the red x in the top right corner and then on the "Shutdown" button.

Now you are ready to run Python code on your local machine!!!
