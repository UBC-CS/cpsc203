#### VS Code extensions

The real magic of VS Code is in the extensions that let you add languages, debuggers, and tools to your installation to support your specific workflow.
We will install some VS Code extensions to help us with our workflows.
From within VS Code you can open up the [Extension Marketplace (read more here)](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-gallery) to browse and install extensions by clicking on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar indicated in the figure below.

To install an extension, you simply search for it in the search bar, click the extension you want, and then click "Install".
There are extensions available to make almost any workflow or task you are interested in more efficient!
Here we are interested in setting up VS Code as a Python IDE. To do this, search for and install the following extensions:

-   **Python** (by Microsoft)
-   **Python Debugger** (by Microsoft)
-   **autoDocString** (by Nils Werner)
-   **Python Indent** (by Kevin Rose)
-   **Black Formatter** (for formatting, linting)
-   **Markdown Table Formatter** (helps format markdown tables)
-   **Rainbow CSV** (for colouring columns in CSV files)
-   **indent-rainbow** (for helping you see indents)
-   **markdownlint** (markdown linting and style checking extension)
