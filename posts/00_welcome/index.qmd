I am excited to welcome you to {{< var course.code >}}!
This short announcement is here to get you oriented to this course website and point out some important resources.
The landing page contains the [schedule](/index.qmd) where you can see all the things happening in the weeks to come and the most recent post in [announcements](/announcements.qmd).
Then take a look at the [syllabus](/syllabus.qmd) to gain an overview of the course and its requirements, but we will discuss it in the first class.

Oh, and if you have a [GitHub.com](https://github/com) account, please feel free to introduce yourself in the comment section.
If you do not have an account yet, don't worry!
We will learn soon how to set one up!
