This week we dive into Python dictionaries through an escape room adventure!

## The Great Data Heist

The Golden DataFrame has been stolen from the Vancouver Museum of Data Science. You'll use dictionary patterns to:

- Find suspects who visited both crime scenes (Boolean/Seen pattern)
- Crack ciphers using frequency analysis (Counter pattern)
- Open the vault with two-sum puzzles (Complement pattern)
- Group suspects by alibi (Grouping pattern)
- Decode escape routes (Translation pattern)

## Why Dictionaries Matter

Dictionaries give you **O(1) lookup** — instant access by key. With datasets of 50,000+ items, this means operations that would take hours with nested loops finish in milliseconds.

These same patterns appear in:
- Coding interviews (Two Sum, Group Anagrams, etc.)
- Real-world data processing
- Advent of Code puzzles

## Examlet 2

Examlet 2 is available in the CBTF this week. Book your time slot on PrairieTest!

## Project 1

Project 1 (Pokémon Data Explorer) is due March 1. Start early and have fun with it!
