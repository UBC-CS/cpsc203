This week there is no new content in this course - it's Reading week!
This week, you'll have an opportunity to catch your breath and catch up on anything from the last few weeks that you didn't have time to grasp or go through.
This may include test questions, missed POTW questions, videos that you didn't watch, activities you didn't finish, or anything else left over.
Though you don't *have to* use this break for CPSC 203, I encourage you to make sure you are actually caught up before re-purposing that time for other courses.

Here's a fun video from a game I enjoyed playing a lot!
