It is my intention to establish a "course pattern" where the only thing that changes from week-to-week is the specific content we're learning that week.
Otherwise, the pattern of videos, homework, class activities, tests, etc. will remain the same.
Set up a schedule for yourself so you can keep up with all the due dates for this course (and your other courses)!
