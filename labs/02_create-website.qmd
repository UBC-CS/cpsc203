## Basic structure of Quarto document

We are going to create a website using a Quarto.
Quarto documents are a mix of natural language and executed code and this pattern is called **literate programming**.
A Quarto document usually contains:

-   Text formatted in Markdown.
-   Code is fenced as code chunk between ```` ```{r} ```` and ```` ``` ````.
-   Metadata as YAML with the format `key: value`. You can find metadata in the header of the document fenced by `---`, or in code chunks starting with `#|`.

```` markdown

title: "Untitled"
format: html

## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into
a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.
