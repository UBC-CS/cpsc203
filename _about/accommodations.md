Accommodations
=======================

Accommodations are intended to remove barriers experienced by individuals with disabilities.
As a matter of principle, UBC is committed to promoting human rights, equity and diversity, and it also has a legal duty under the BC Human Rights Code to make its goods and services available in a manner that does not discriminate.
[Policy 73](https://universitycounsel.ubc.ca/files/2019/02/policy73.pdf) (Accommodation for Students with Disabilities) sets out principles and processes governing the accommodation of students with disabilities.

All accommodations for this course are handled through the [Centre for Accessibility](https://students.ubc.ca/about-student-services/centre-for-accessibility) (CfA).  If you feel that you may face barriers falling under Policy 73, I encourage you to contact the CfA to book an appointment as soon as possible, as it can take some time to complete the approval process.

Students who have accommodation(s) approved through the Centre for Accessibility should email their accommodation letter directly to the instructor within the first two weeks of term (or immediately upon approval if that approval occurs during the term).
