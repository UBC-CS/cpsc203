### Late Policy

```{attention}
Many assessments in the "Homework" category may be submitted after the original deadline for partial credit.  The amount of partial credit and the corresponding deadlines can be found in PrairieLearn.

Assessments in the "Exam" category **must** be completed in the time window specified for that particular assessment.
```

```{note}
Please refer to the [UBC Calendar](https://students.ubc.ca/enrolment/exams/exam-clashes-hardships-cancellations) for details on exam clashes, hardships, and cancellations.
```

### What if I miss labs, tests, or the exam due to an illness, health, or other personal situations?

Normally, most assessments in this course have multi-day window or a generous grace period, which should suffice to account for unexpected but short-term absences.

For longer term absences (a week or more), please contact the instructor to discuss options.

If ill health is an issue, students are encouraged to seek attention from a health professional.  UBC's [Student Health and Wellbeing website](https://students.ubc.ca/health/) has links to many different resources.

```{tip}
Don't be shy or embarassed to use these health services, and if the first one doesn't work for you, try another!
```

### What should I do if I need accommodations to be successful in this course?

### Compassion

Overall, my philosophy is that I think we could all use some extra compassion and humanity wherever and whenever it's possible.
If you're going through something that is affecting you (in the course or otherwise), you are always welcome to come and talk to me about it. 
If I am not able to help you myself, then I can probably direct you to the right person or resource on campus.
If you need extra help, or extra time to deal with something you're going through, just ask.
You will *never* owe me an explanation about your physical health, mental health, or those of your family members, friends, etc... I will believe you, and I will trust you.
I will not judge you, nor think any less of you.
I will do everything in my power to work out something that is both reasonable and fair. 
This, I promise!
