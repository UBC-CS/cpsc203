### How do I go through this course with integrity?

I want to be proud of your work in this course, and I want YOU to be proud of yourself as well!
That cannot happen if you make unethical decisions, including (but not limited) to cheating or plagiarism.
According to the scientific literature, the most common reasons students cheat are:

- Fear of failure and life consequences.
- Peer pressure, including the pressure to provide your answers when others ask for help.
- Perceived societal acceptance of cheating (such as Lance Armstrong, Barry Bonds, Enron, Wall Street & The Big Short).
- Desire for success without the time/desire to put in the work needed.
- Strict deadlines and due-dates.
- Requirement from instructors to memorize facts, figures, equations, etc...
- High-stakes exams with no recompense for "having a bad day".
- Peers cheating with no consequences or penalties.
- Unclear expectations on what constitutes academic dishonesty.
- Inadequate support from instructor and teaching team.

However, taking short-cuts when learning leads to poor learning.
I have tried extremely hard to make this course focused on learning rather than grading, and where grading is needed to have policies that are as student-friendly as possible.
In particular, I hope (and expect) that the following features of the course should eliminate your temptation to cheat or plagiarize:

- {{ GRACE_PERIOD }} grace-period on all due dates.
- Long testing window so you can start the tests when you are comfortable.
- No high-stakes exams (the single largest assessment item is the final exam).
- Plenty of TA and instructor student hours and several outside of normal business hours.
- Class website that outlines exactly what you should do when to help you manage your time.
- Tonnes of supplemental materials including other instructional videos in case you want a different perspective.
- Weekly prompt to accept the integrity pledge to keep you accountable.
- A true willingness from the instructor (me) to help you learn and succeed in this course!
<!-- 
- Each test has a "bonus test" available one week later; for each test, we will take the better score of the pair.
- All course assessments are completely open book, open notes, and open web (except for cheating websites like Chegg, CourseHero, Slader, Bartleby, etc...)
-->

With these features, and several other little things, I sincerely hope that you will consider completing this course with maximum integrity so that you never have to feel guilty, ashamed, or disappointed in yourself and your actions!

### What is considered academic dishonesty in this course?

The line between what constitutes acceptable versus unacceptable behaviour can be blurry, but here is a list of things which are **definitely** considered academic dishonesty in CPSC 203:

- Asking others to see their work (whether question by question, or all at once).
- Sharing your work with others.
- Doing tests collaboratively (tests **must** be done by yourself and alone).
- Communicating test questions and/or answers to others.  We all benefit from the scheduling flexibility that PrairieLearn provides, but that means even if you have completed a test you **cannot talk about it** because other students may not have taken it yet.
- Sharing any course material onto Chegg, Course Hero, Slader, or other similar sites.
- Searching for solutions to course material on Chegg, Course Hero, Slader, or other similar sites.
- Blindly googling the question in hopes of finding someone who had a similar question and then copying their answer.  However, googling to find resources to understand specific concepts or general ideas is highly encouraged!
- Having a tutor/friend/nemesis complete and submit your work for you.
- Copying and pasting code, equations, text explanations, prose, etc... without attribution.
- Manipulating the learning platforms we use to reverse engineer the randomization algorithms, hacking the timer functionality, or other similar technical [malfeasance](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/malfeasance).
