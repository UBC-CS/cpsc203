UBC's Point Grey Campus is located on the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territory of the [xʷməθkʷəy̓əm (Musqueam)](https://www.musqueam.bc.ca/) people.
The land it is situated on has always been a place of learning for the Musqueam people, who for millennia have passed on their culture, history, and traditions from one generation to the next on this site.
