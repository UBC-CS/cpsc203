### Why is Git so complicated?

Each feature of Git is designed to solve particular issues that arise when managing versions of potentially large, distributed, and long-term projects, and understanding how to use Git may be made easier if you think about the issue you are trying to solve first.

*Ian needs to create a list / table outlining the common issues and which git command / workflow is used to resolve them.*

## Guided Activity 1: Intro to Git and GitHub

You will need to get into a group of 3 for this activity, and it would be best if you all sat together.

- Contributor 1
- Contributor 2
- Contributor 3

### Tasks:
Tasks to be completed by all members unless otherwise specified.

- Get into groups of 3.
- *Contributor 1 only*: Create a new repository from the [Class Activity 6B]() template repository.
  - Follow the link.
  - Click on `Use this template`.
  - Choose yourself as the owner.
  - Create a new repository name.
  - Select *Public* repository (not Private).
- Clone the new repository onto local machines (using the terminal).
- Open the local repo in VS Code.
- Independently make changes to `functions.py` to fix *one* of the functions (based on which contributor you are) in VS Code.
- Commit changes to **local** repos.  **Do not push!!**
## Guided Activity 2: Code Reviews

We'll now do a demo on how to submit a Pull Request, and do a code review.
