# Class Meeting 5B

There were no slides for today's lecture.  

In [Class Activity 5B](https://us.prairielearn.com/pl/course_instance/172874/assessment/2495518), we converted the Hot-100 data into a suitable form (a list of dictionaries) for it to be loaded it into Pandas, and then we explored various manipulations we can perform using Pandas powerful (if sometimes obscure) overloading of the `[]` (square brackets) operator.  We also touched briefly on Python's [formatted string literals](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#tut-f-strings) (also commonly called "f-strings").
