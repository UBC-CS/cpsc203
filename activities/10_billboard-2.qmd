  {{< var icon.computer-activity >}} Wrangling Billboard Hot 100 data
---

In [Class Activity 5B]({{< var course.prairielearn >}}/assessment/2495518), we will convert the Billboard Hot 100 data into a suitable form (a list of dictionaries) for them to be loaded it into pandas, and then we explore various manipulations we can perform using pandas powerful (if sometimes obscure) overloading of the `[]` (square brackets) operator.
We also touch briefly on Python's [formatted string literals](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#tut-f-strings) (also commonly called "f-strings").
