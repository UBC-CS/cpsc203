## Logistics

I made significant changes to the starter file `demoA.py`, so I recommend that you get the new copy from the [Template repository for class activity 11A](https://github.com/ubc-cpsc203-2023W2/class-activity-11A).

- If you just cloned the original repository, you can `git pull` the changes.
- If you made a copy of the original repository, you will have to get the changes and merge them into your own copy.
