What does it mean to be *represented*?

This question sits at the heart of computer science in two surprising ways. Today we're going on a journey—from the cultural richness of colour, down to the electrical signals inside your computer, and back up to some big questions about who gets to shape the technology we all use.

Ready? Let's go.

## The Cultural Richness of Colour

Before we dive into bits and bytes, let's start with something personal: **What's your favorite colour?**

[]{.hexagon-red}[]{.hexagon-orange}[]{.hexagon-yellow}[]{.hexagon-green}[]{.hexagon-blue}[]{.hexagon-violet}

No, really—take a moment to think about it. Is it [blue]{.blue}, like the ocean on a clear day? [Red]{.red}, like the poppies that bloom in spring? [Green]{.green}, like the forests that cool our cities?

Do you know *why* it's your favorite? Does it show up in your wardrobe, your room decor, the things you're drawn to when you shop?

Colour is *weird*. It's deeply personal, but it's also culturally loaded in ways we don't always notice:

- [**Red**]{.red} []{.swatch-red} means luck and celebration in Chinese culture... but danger and warning in Western contexts. Same colour, totally different vibes!
- **White** []{.swatch-white} symbolizes purity and weddings in many Western traditions... but mourning and funerals in some Eastern cultures. Imagine the confusion at an international wedding!
- [**Purple**]{.purple} []{.swatch-purple} was once *the* colour of royalty (because the dye was ridiculously expensive)... but has taken on completely different meanings today.

These associations aren't random—they're woven into centuries of art, literature, religion, and daily life. Colour carries *meaning*.

So here's the question that should blow your mind a little: **How do we take something this rich and nuanced and make a computer understand it?**

## How Computers "See" Colour

Spoiler alert: they don't. Not really. But we've found a clever workaround.

### It All Starts with Electricity

Let's go all the way down to the bottom. Inside your computer, *everything*—and I mean **everything**—comes down to electrical charges.

![Close-up of a solid-state drive (SSD) circuit board. All data—including your favorite cat photos and every colour in them—is ultimately stored as electrical charges in chips like these. Wild, right?](/images/ssd.jpg){fig-alt="A solid-state drive circuit board with visible memory chips and electronic components."}

See those chips? They're full of tiny transistors holding or releasing electrons, creating regions of positive and negative charge. Your computer interprets these charges as **bits**: binary digits that can be either 0 or 1.

That's it. Just two states. On or off. Yes or no. One or zero.

Is that *really* enough to represent... everything? 🤔

### From Bits to Numbers (It's Just Counting!)

Here's where it gets fun. You already know how to count in base 10:

| 3 | 1 | 5 | 7 |
|---|---|---|---|
| 3 × 10³ | 1 × 10² | 5 × 10¹ | 7 × 10⁰ |
| 3000 | 100 | 50 | 7 |

The number 3157 is just: three thousands, one hundred, five tens, and seven ones.

Now here's the trick—we can do *exactly the same thing* in base 2:

| 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 × 2³ | 0 × 2² | 1 × 2¹ | 1 × 2⁰ |
| 8 | 0 | 2 | 1 |

So 1011 in binary = 8 + 0 + 2 + 1 = **11** in decimal.

**Pop quiz!** 🎯

- What's the highest number you can make with 4 bits?
- What about 5 bits?

*(Think about it before scrolling...)*

With 4 bits: 1111 = 8+4+2+1 = **15** (that's $2^4 - 1$, or 16 possible values: 0 through 15)

With 5 bits: 11111 = **31** (that's $2^5 - 1$, or 32 possible values)

In general, $n$ bits gives you $2^n$ different values. Math is cool. 😎

### From Numbers to Colours: RGB

Okay, so we can represent numbers with bits. But how do we get from numbers to *colours*?

We just... agree on a system! The most common one is **RGB**: [**R**ed]{.red}, [**G**reen]{.green}, [**B**lue]{.blue}.

Each colour component gets a number from 0 to 255. (Why 255? Because that's exactly $2^8 - 1$—the range of an 8-bit number. Everything connects!)

Check it out:

- `(255, 0, 0)` = pure [**red**]{.red} []{.swatch-red} (max [red]{.red}, no [green]{.green}, no [blue]{.blue})
- `(0, 255, 0)` = pure [**green**]{.green} []{.swatch-green}
- `(0, 0, 255)` = pure [**blue**]{.blue} []{.swatch-blue}
- `(255, 255, 0)` = [**yellow**]{.yellow} []{.swatch-yellow} ([red]{.red} + [green]{.green}, no [blue]{.blue}—try it!)
- `(255, 0, 127)` = a lovely [**pink**]{.pink} []{.swatch-pink}

By mixing different amounts of [red]{.red}, [green]{.green}, and [blue]{.blue} light, we can create...

$256 \times 256 \times 256 = $ **16,777,216 different colours!** 🌈

That's more colours than most humans can distinguish. Not bad for a bunch of 1s and 0s!

### Hexadecimal: Because Programmers Are Lazy (In a Good Way)

Writing `(103, 78, 167)` every time you want a specific [purple]{.purple} is tedious. And writing the binary version?

```
0110 0111 0100 1110 1010 0111
```

Ugh. Nobody wants that.

Enter **hexadecimal** (base 16). Instead of 10 digits, we use 16: `0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 a b c d e f`

The magic: each hex digit represents *exactly* 4 bits. So we can write any colour in just 6 characters:

```
0110 0111 0100 1110 1010 0111  (binary - 24 digits 😫)
   6    7    4    e    a    7  (hex - 6 characters 😊)
```

Which we write as: **`#674ea7`** []{.swatch-purple}

You've probably seen hex codes in web design, CSS, or design tools. Now you know what they actually mean!

🎨 **Want to play?** Check out <https://colorizer.org> and try converting between RGB and hex. It's weirdly satisfying.

## Stop and Feel Two Things

At this point, I want you to notice something. You might be feeling:

1. **Wonder** ✨ — It's genuinely amazing that we can represent 16 million colours using just 1s and 0s! The layered abstraction—from electrons to bits to numbers to colours—is kind of beautiful.

2. **Unease** 😕 — Something feels *lost*. All that cultural richness, the personal associations, the emotional weight of colour... none of it survives in `(255, 0, 127)`.

Both feelings are valid! This tension is at the heart of all digital representation: **to make something computational, we have to reduce it.**

Keep that thought. We're going to need it.

## The Plot Twist: A Second Meaning of "Representation"

Look at these six colours:

::: {style="max-width: 250px;"}
| [R]{.red} | [G]{.green} | [B]{.blue} |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 255 | 0 | 0 |
| 17 | 0 | 178 |
| 45 | 0 | 13 |
| 200 | 0 | 220 |
| 62 | 0 | 37 |
| 130 | 0 | 95 |
:::

Notice anything? 👀

**They all have [green]{.green} = 0.**

These are all in the [purple]{.purple}/[magenta]{.pink} family—mixes of [red]{.red} and [blue]{.blue} with *zero* [green]{.green}.

Now imagine an RGB colour cube—a 3D box where each axis represents one colour channel (0 to 255). Every possible colour lives somewhere in that cube!

![The RGB colour cube. Every possible colour lives somewhere in this cube! [Image: COLORCUBE](https://www.colorcube.com/puzzle/puzzle.htm)](/images/rgb_cube.jpg){fig-alt="A three-dimensional RGB color cube showing how red, green, and blue axes create a space of possible colors." width="300"}

**Try it yourself!** Drag to rotate the cube and explore the colour space:

<iframe src="/interactives/rgb_cube.html" width="100%" height="400" style="border: 1px solid #ddd; border-radius: 8px;"></iframe>

When [green]{.green} = 0, we're stuck on just one face of this cube. A flat plane. We can *never* create:

- The [green]{.green} of spring leaves []{.swatch-green}
- The [teal]{.cyan} of tropical waters []{.swatch-cyan}
- The [yellow]{.yellow} of sunflowers []{.swatch-yellow}
- Anything that needs even a *hint* of [green]{.green}

**An entire dimension just... doesn't exist.** 😱

### Here's Where It Gets Real

This is more than a fun fact about colour spaces. It's a **metaphor**.

Just as removing the [green]{.green} channel limits the colours we can create, **limiting the diversity of people in computer science limits the ideas we can explore.**

Think about it:

- When everyone on a team has similar backgrounds and experiences, they've effectively removed dimensions from the "idea space"
- They build solutions that work great for people like them... and poorly for everyone else
- They don't see problems that don't affect them personally
- They perpetuate biases they don't even know they have

This isn't about being "nice" or "politically correct." It's about **technical excellence**. The best solutions come from teams that can see problems from multiple angles.

**Representation matters—in both senses of the word.**

## Let's Write Some Code!

Enough philosophy—let's actually *use* what we've learned. Here's a fun challenge:

**Make the poppies pop!** 🌺

![A field of red poppies. Our mission: make the flowers stand out by fading everything else to gray.](/images/poppyfield.jpg){fig-alt="A field of bright red poppies with green stems and leaves."}

The plan:
1. Look at each pixel
2. If it's very [red]{.red} (probably a poppy!), leave it alone
3. Otherwise, convert it to [gray]{.gray}

Simple, right? Let's code it!

### The Code

💡 **Copy this code** (click the icon in the top-right corner) and paste it into your own Python environment to run it!

```python
import numpy as np
from skimage import io
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

Pixel = tuple[np.uint8, np.uint8, np.uint8]  # (r, g, b)

def boost_red_pixel(p: Pixel) -> Pixel:
    """Make non-red pixels gray, keep red pixels vibrant."""
    red = int(p[0])
    green = int(p[1])
    blue = int(p[2])

    # Calculate gray value (average of all channels)
    grey = (red + green + blue) // 3

    # If not very red, make it gray
    if red < 200:
        red = green = blue = grey

    return (red, green, blue)

def fancify(img: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """Apply our effect to every pixel in the image."""
    H, W = img.shape[:2]  # Height and Width
    out = img.copy()

    # Visit every single pixel (this is the nested loop pattern!)
    for row in range(H):
        for col in range(W):
            out[row, col] = boost_red_pixel(img[row, col])

    return out

def main():
    # Grab the image from the web
    url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UBC-CS/cpsc203/refs/heads/main/images/poppyfield.jpg'
    img = io.imread(url)[..., :3]  # Keep only RGB channels

    # Work our magic
    out = fancify(img)

    # Show off the result!
    plt.imshow(out)
    plt.axis('off')
    plt.show()

main()
```

### What's Actually Happening?

**The nested loop** is the key pattern here. We're visiting every pixel in order:

```
┌─────┬─────┬─────┬─────┐
│  1  │  2  │  3  │  4  │  ← row 0
├─────┼─────┼─────┼─────┤
│  5  │  6  │  7  │  8  │  ← row 1
├─────┼─────┼─────┼─────┤
│  9  │ 10  │ 11  │ 12  │  ← row 2
└─────┴─────┴─────┴─────┘
```

Row by row, column by column. For a 400×600 image, that's $400 \times 600 = 240{,}000$ pixels!

(Remember Week 1? This is $O(n^2)$ behavior. Efficiency matters!)

### Your Turn! 🎮

Try these experiments:

1. **Boost [green]{.green} instead** — What threshold works well for leaves?
2. **Change the threshold** — Try 150 or 250 instead of 200
3. **Invert instead of gray** — Use `red = 255 - red` for a trippy negative effect
4. **Reverse the logic** — Keep the *non-red* pixels and gray out the red ones

The best way to understand this stuff? **Play with it.** Break things. See what happens. That's how you build intuition!

## What Did We Learn?

Let's zoom out. Today's journey:

**Technical stuff:**
- Computers store everything as bits (1s and 0s)
- Bits → numbers → colours (it's abstractions all the way down!)
- RGB gives us 16+ million colours
- Hex is just a compact way to write RGB values

**Big ideas:**
- Digital representation requires *reduction*—we lose richness
- Missing dimensions limit what's possible
- Diversity in tech isn't just nice—it's *technically necessary*

**Skills:**
- Binary and hexadecimal conversion
- RGB colour representation
- Nested loops for image processing
- Breaking problems into functions

## Coming Up

We've focused on *what* computers represent and *why* representation matters. Next time, we'll dig into *how* we represent more complex data—and why different choices lead to different tradeoffs.

But for now: go play with colours! 🎨 Find a hex code you love. Write some code that manipulates images in weird ways. Make something unexpected.

That's where the real learning happens.
