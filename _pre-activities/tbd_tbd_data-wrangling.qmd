### pandas in data science tutorial

Some of you have asked me for advanced pandas tutorials for your own side-projects and other courses.

You can download the [`pokemon.csv` dataset here](https://github.com/firasm/bits/raw/master/pokemon.csv) and [this notebook here](https://github.com/ubco-cmps/data301_course/raw/main/notes/week05/week05_pokemon.ipynb).
