The best way to get personalized help in this course is to attend the "Student Hours" we have scheduled for this course.  This is time that the instructor and TAs have set aside to help YOU personally, 1 on 1!
I understand it might feel intimidating to come to Student Hours, but we don't bite!
We would love to hear about you, what your interests are, and if you have any career advice. 
If nobody comes to the Student Hours, we end up sitting all by ourselves, all alone, and sad.

A few other notes:

- We will be using {{ FORUM_LINK }} for Announcements in this course.
- For **all** course-related questions you can reach out to the teaching team including instructors and TAs via {{ FORUM_LINK }}.
- You are encouraged to post questions publicly whenever possible so others can benefit; however, do not publicly post assessment solutions (even partial ones).
- For issues which are not suitable for public posts, you can send
  - A private message to the instructional team on {{ FORUM_LINK }} if you message *does not* contain personal information; for example, if you have a question about your solution code.
  - By email to the instructor if your message contains personal information; for example, your CfA letter or a request for concession.
- Any student may visit the student hour for any member of the teaching team (TA or instructor)! In other words, you can go to the student hour of ANY TA, not just the one whose lab/tutorial you are registered in.
