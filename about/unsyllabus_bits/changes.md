In this section, I will outline any changes that have been made to the unsyllabus as we go through the course.
We will do our best to follow the plan outlined in this unsyllabus, but in case things go south, I will need to make adjustments to the contents and the schedule.

Any major changes to the syllabus (this page) will be documented here, as well as the date the change was made. 

| Change Date  | Summary                                                                                               | Rationale |

| Jan 18, 2024 | Removed left-over language about assessments being open-book, open-web now that we are using the CBTF | Unfortunately, the CBTF does not yet allow open-book and open-web assessments so our Examlets and final exam need to be closed book with no access to web resources. This was always the intention, and there was one instance that I copied from another course (which doesn't use the CBTF!). Apologies for the oversight.      |
| Jan 22, 2024  |  Removed left-over language about "bonus tests" since we're not doing that this year.   | We will have a slightly different scheme for recovering lost points  to be released later in the term. |
