Tech Stack
=======================

As with any computer science or data science course, several tools and software packages are needed for this course.
These tools are not used by the typical consumer, so most Windows or macOS installations will not include them.  Even on machines which do include them (such as many Linux distributions), they may still need some configuration.
Below you will find guides to install the "Tech Stack" for {{ COURSE_CODE }}, with different guides for different operating systems.
A "Tech Stack" is the complete set of tools and technologies needed to accomplish a particular task; in this case, it is the various programming and data analytics that we will explore in {{ COURSE_CODE }}.

As you go through the install guides, remember that perhaps the two most important things you will learn in this course is how to troubleshoot things and achieve familiarity and proficiency with your computer.
Be patient, read things carefully, do not be afraid to try things, it's unlikely you will do anything to irreversibly break your computer! 
Almost everything you do (you're on your own if you decide to take a hammer to your laptop!) can be undone, don't be afraid to ask your peers, TAs, and the instructor on {{ FORUM_LINK }}.

This is an exciting time for you as you begin your Software Development journey!
