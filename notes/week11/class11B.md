# Class Meeting 11B

Today's class is cancelled so you have some time to get started on Project 2.
One of our TAs, Minh, has made a video to help you get started if you're stuck.

```{dropdown} 1. Introduction to Project 2

## Logistics

Nothing to clone for today - I think!

<!-- 
1. Clone the Class Activity Repository

You will first need to "accept" the GitHub Classroom assignment to get a copy of the starter code.

You can do that by [clicking here](https://classroom.github.com/a/9O9S8RgF).

Then, clone the `classActivity0XY` repository by running the following line in your Terminal:

```
git clone <your_clone_url>
``` -->
