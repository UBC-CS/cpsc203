## Logistics

1. Clone the Class Activity Repository

You will first need to "accept" the GitHub Classroom assignment to get a copy of the starter code.

You can do that by [clicking here](https://classroom.github.com/a/ACntc8CV).

Then, clone the `classActivity0XY` repository by running the following line in your Terminal:

```
git clone <your_clone_url>
```
