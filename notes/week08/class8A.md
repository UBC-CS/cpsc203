## Logistics

1. Jupyter Lab

For class today, you will need to install JupyterLab because we'll be using an `.ipynb` file to use the `%%timeit` cell-magic.
You can do this by running the following command in the Terminal:

```
conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab
```

You can then run `jupyter lab` in the Terminal to launch a JupyterLab instance.

2. Clone the Class Activity Repository

You will first need to "accept" the GitHub Classroom assignment to get a copy of the starter code.

You can do that by [clicking here](https://classroom.github.com/a/o6D2NVBz).

Then, clone the `classActivity0XY` repository by running the following line in your Terminal:

```
git clone <your_clone_url>
```
