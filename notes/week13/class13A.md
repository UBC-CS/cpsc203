## Logistics

### Installing packages

You will probably need to install some packages for today's class:

- `conda install osmnx`
- `conda install networkx`
- `conda install folium`
- `conda install scikit-learn`
- `conda install mapclassify`

### Cloning a repository

1. Clone the Class Activity Repository

You will first need to "accept" the GitHub Classroom assignment to get a copy of the starter code.

You can do that by [clicking here](https://classroom.github.com/a/qYP0az4U).

Then, clone the `classActivity1XY` repository by running the following line in your Terminal:

```
git clone <your_clone_url>
```
